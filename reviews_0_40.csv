One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!"", 'This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it\'s routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as ""Woody"" and Allen as ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don\'t diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed ""winner"" as is the sequel.', 'I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy\'s birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don\'t want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he\'s the most popular one of them all. He\'s the only one that hasn\'t got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren\'t always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that\'s true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren\'t yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.', 'What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It\'s a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can\'t really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the ""humanity"" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.', ""Toy Story – 5/5 starsChildren play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc\x85 But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.''Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway."", ""Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with."", 'This is as close to perfection as any animated film has come, entertained parents on a equal plane with their children, and set the bar to the top of the animation film industry. No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors. Great comedies are hard to come by - Toy Story strikes gold on that basis alone, but is so much more. One of the Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time, and currently resides on my ""Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films (1960-Present)"" list.', '""I believe that a filmmaker\'s entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified."" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He\'s a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn\'t Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he\'s a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg\'s weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can\'t face the dour reality that is the ""real world of toys"".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the ""chosen ones"", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. ""Nirvana is coming!"" the aliens whisper, watching as the ""chosen ones"" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is ""just an ordinary toy"" who ""can not fly"". ""Flying"" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the ""flesh"" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become ""something more"".Buzz\'s first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. ""I am not a toy!"" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can\'t fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children\'s film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What\'s the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid\'s franchise? It\'s like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (""Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?"").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn\'t define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not ""up in the skies"". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody\'s words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the ""greater good of his family"" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the ""moral code"" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: ""To Infinity and Beyond!"" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, ""Toy Story"" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since ""Snow White"".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter\'s themes here with his first Pixar feature, ""The Incredibles"". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.', 'Y\'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn\'t looking! In Andy\'s Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there\'s a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy\'s birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy\'s gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels \x96 in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature \x96 just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney\'s tyrannical umbrella overarches this film\'s production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney\'s craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar\'s first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz\'s greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz\'s escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy\'s family was Pixar\'s triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney\'s *idée fixe* of the 1950\'s nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz \x96 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy\'s favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it\'s instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz\'s ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie\'s greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master\'s infallible toy filing system\x85.']"
1,2,113497,8844.0,"[""Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!"", ""The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die!Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter \x96 I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families."", 'I just used to love ""Jumanji"" as a kid. This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy ""Jumanji"". It\'s a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with.Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it \'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter? You\'ll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I\'d highly recommend it for a good watch. It\'s just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy ""Jumanji""! 8/10', 'You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can\'t dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.Oh and one more thing: from ""Jumanji"", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.', 'In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called ""Jumanji"" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan\'s father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. ""Jumanji"" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90\'s. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jumanji""', ""I watched this classic in 2021 for the first time. Trust me, I never felt like old boring stuff. It was truly amazing. Nor, after watching the Jumanji movies till now except for this, did I find this one to be similar. It was different. It was Classical. It was a great show. Fantastical Fantasy. Good adventure although latest ones have lot more. However, this, suprised me considering I had made up my mind of what Jumanji could be. But this was truly amazing. Although latest ones have great cast, next level VFX, astounding adventure, this one's the best. I do love the first part of the latest ones that came in 2017, I'd find rather take a tie between the two than selecting one. Thank you. However, lemme tell you, it was leaving Prime, so I watched and it was worth it."", ""I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was.The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done.This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too."", 'While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox', 'In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called ""Jumanji"", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan\'s token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished.Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game\'s jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human.The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn\'t Williams\' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like ""Dead Poet\'s Society"" or ""Good Morning, Vietnam""- but it\'s a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality.This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one\'s fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father\'s approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan\'s father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor.Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the ""Narnia"" stories).Fortunately, any moralising in ""Jumanji"" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of ""alternative timelines"". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today\'s techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10']"
2,3,113228,15602.0,"['Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli\'s follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER\'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it\'s own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max\'s son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson\'s (Lemmon\'s) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John\'s father (Burgess Meredith).I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith\'s final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can\'t get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa\'s ashes are scattered.The continuity theme is also in the portion about ""Catfish Hunter"" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa\'s youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa\'s ashes. So the legend is returned to it\'s base.Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film\'s conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well.', ""If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can't imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film.Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it's Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they're up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else.And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon's father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon's daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau's son you won't believe what's going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids.Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn't feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman.Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high."", '""Grumpier Old Men"" is the equally funny sequel to ""Grumpy Old Men"". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John\'s new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon\'s horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon\'s daughter and Matthau\'s son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in ""Grumpier Old Men"" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men\'s beloved bait shop into a \'ristorante\' as she puts it. The grumps don\'t like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It\'s great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it\'s predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four)', 'Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie ""Grumpy Old Men"". I don\'t agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love ""Buddy Buddy"" and ""The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we\'ve lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile.', ""A sequel to the thoroughly enjoyable Grumpy Old Men, 'Grumpier Old Men' is A Sweet Film, with Lively Performances. The sequel has the spirit of its prequel & the amazing cast, led by the impeccable talents of the Late/Great Jack Lemmon & the Late/Great Walter Matthau, are in full form! 'Grumpier Old Men' Synopsis: John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max's attention.'Grumpier Old Men' works well as a romantic-comedy, as it has moments of humour & subtle romance. I loved the prequel & I must say, the sequel doesn't fail to deliver. The film has sustained its energy & wit, that one would expect from it.Mark Steven Johnson's Screenplay is entertaining, although initially the pace is slightly slow. Howard Deutch's Direction is top-class. Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography is good. Editing also is ably done. Performance-Wise: Lemmon & Matthau shine all through. Its their sheer on-screen chemistry, that alone is worth watching the entire film. Sophia Loren is top-notch. Ann-Margret is impressive. Kevin Pollak & Daryl Hannah leave a mark. Late/Great Burgess Meredith is memorable in his part.On the whole, 'Grumpier Old Men' is a smooth, relaxing watch."", 'The best part about ""Grumpier Old Men"" is Burgess Meredith\'s character. He\'s even funnier here than in the original...and I love his version of ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears""! As for the rest, it\'s pretty much what you got in the first film...though with an emphasis on a new character (Sophia Loren) and the upcoming nuptials of two other characters (John\'s daughter and Max\'s son).The story picks up some time after the first film. John is married to Ariel and he and his nemesis, Max, are getting along better. Much of this might be because their kids are getting serious and talking marriage. Plus they have something else to unite them in the story...their hatred of a new lady, Maria (Loren). Why? Well, she bought their old bait shop and is turning it into a restaurant....and the pair do a lot to try to sabotage the place. These scenes are pretty funny. However, later, Max and Maria start dating....and the kids have a breakup. What\'s next? See the film.This is a cute and enjoyable film. Nothing life-changing or super original but still fun and occasionally funny. Worth seeing if you liked the first one and better than most sequels.', 'John and Max resolve to save their beloved bait shop from turning into an Italian restaurant, just as its new female owner catches Max\'s attention.We often expect sequels to be weaker than the original. But sometimes we may be pleasantly surprised. In this sequel, the ""grumpy old men"" are still up to their old tricks, going after each other and teaming up to close down a restaurant. Some of it may be a bit far-fetched (in real life, a store owner would get the cops involved) but it\'s good fun.Sadly, the film has the distinction of being Burgess Meredith\'s final film. On the plus side, he really goes out with a bang. His acting and delivery of witty lines is top notch, and the film does a great job of hiding his Alzheimer\'s. You can really feel the talent in his character.', ""Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age."", 'After the success of ""Grumpy Old Men"" a sequel was inevitable. The fact that it\'s also inferior to the hilarious first movie was also inevitable. Plot In A Paragraph: John and Max are still on good terms following the events at the end of last movie. They still greet each other in the same way, but now with affection. They join forces to save their beloveds bait shop from being turned into an Italian restaurant by its new owner (Sophia Loren) who has just took over.Almost all of the cast from the first movie return, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are their usual brilliant self, with their usual awesome charisma. Ann Margaret isn\'t given much to do this time around. Sophia Loren is certainly still a sex bomb. Burgess Meredith is back, and is as smutty if not smithies than the first time around. Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollack both return too, and are both as reliable as you\'d expect.Sadly, Grumpier Old Men was Burgess Meredith\'s final film. He looks in bad shape here, but still puts in a good fun, full of life performance.']"
3,4,114885,31357.0,"[""This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting. IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops & horrible movies."", 'I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some ""man-bashing"" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today\'s world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it\'s important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)', 'I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can\'t say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch \'Homeward Bound\' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her ""act"", well, Chesty Morgan\'s performance in ""Deadly Weapons"" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn\'t going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn\'t really disappointed in the film, it just slid off...', 'WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. ""Waiting To Exhale"", Forrest Whitaker\'s take on Terry McMillan\'s popular book, had a rather popular following upon it\'s release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it\'s star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene.""Waiting To Exhale"" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone.It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn\'t know the word ""feelings"" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it\'s screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change.For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it\'s 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they\'ve experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don\'t seem to learn squat.It\'s like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. ""Waiting To Exhale"" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose.... D ...', ""While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great."", 'I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It\'s not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don\'t have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others.Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn\'t think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn\'t sleep around, wasn\'t a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines\' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I\'m glad this was addressed in the movie.Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn\'t perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end.Lela Rochon didn\'t display any acting talent here and wasn\'t quite up to the job of conveying Robin\'s vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn\'t seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer\'s disease. I don\'t feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn\'t seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men.Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said ""I\'m smart, I\'m a good person and I work hard."" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn\'t have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn\'t like at all and doesn\'t even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn\'t really seem interested in her friends\'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end.This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn\'t ""tell this story"" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn\'t get a strong sense of who they were.Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue?', 'The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the ""Hood"" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies ""Exhale"" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times!Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could\'ve gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn\'t. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance!As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker\'s my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it.Despite the box-office success of ""Waiting to Exhale"" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie ""How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!""Read my review of ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back""', ""Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her."", ""Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.

The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again.This is very much a woman's film and, as a man, it's easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love \x96in, so I won't.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest.The soapy sentiment isn't helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r'n'b stuff \x96 but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing \x96 only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect.Why \x96 can someone tell me \x96 was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She's a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes \x96 she needs to stay in TVM's.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she's in. Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too \x96 there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1 \x96 everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2 \x96 Wesley Snipes' character just don't convince me at all.Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It's a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it.""]"

He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance.

This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism."", 'That is one of my favorite lines, followed by ""and pack up your things and hit the road!

The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner."", 'The first ""Father of the Bride"" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin\'s great comedic ""Dad"" character with the emotions of marrying off his ""only"" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think ""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls"") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, ""Father of the Bride II"" does not fall into this trap.With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George\'s wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women!Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George\'s equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George\'s identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family.Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let\'s just say that if a ""Grandfather of the Bride"" were in the works, I would be first in line.', ""It's a sequel that definitely didn't need to be made, but despite that and some pointlessness that ensues within it- Father of the Bride Part II is an often charming little comedy that still manages to have the genuine heart of its predecessor. From the get go this film largely feels like a bunch of random ideas for a sequel strung together to form a plot. It's a bit messy, formulaic, and even corny at times- but somehow it still manages to be entertaining- and you won't want to stop watching in concern of what may happen next. The acting is about the same as before, Martin and Williams-Paisley often carry the film with their chemistry- and provide for the large heart the film has and honestly make it far more easy to watch. I don't know what it is about the film that I enjoyed so much, but it is bound to leave you smiling. It's not original, or as well done as the first film, but it manages to get in the same spirit and make me laugh quite a bit- and I think that's truly all you can ask to a sequel to a film about a wedding.My Rating: 7/10.""]"
5,6,113277,949.0,"['I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like ""Heat"". However, on a lark and because it\'s apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.The biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It\'s almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro\'s oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.There\'s very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino\'s character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it\'s just me....Overall, if you don\'t mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing. Extremely well-directed and never dull.', 'Heat (1995) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows an underground high end burglary team looking for one big last mission and a parallel story about a successful police officer who is struggling at home. As the buildup to the big heist unfolds the two worlds come closer and closer together until the ultimate collision happens.This movie is directed by Michael Mann (Ali) and stars Robert De Niro (Goodfellas), Al Pacino (Scarface), Val Kilmer (Willow), Jon Voight (Anaconda), Mykelti Williamson (Forest Gump), Ashley Judd (Kiss the Girls), Tom Sizemore (Black Hawk Down), Wes Studi (Deep Rising), Natalie Portman (Leon: The Professional), Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs) and Dennis Haysbert (Far from Heaven).This cast is absolutely amazing top to bottom. The writing is also excellent and delivers the backstories to each character to perfection and the dialogue is out of this world. The chemistry of the cast throughout the film worked perfectly and the action scenes are intense and very well done. You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film. The conclusion to such a huge movie is excellent and fits the film perfectly.This is an all time classic that is an absolute must see and an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.', 'I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn\'t make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn\'t disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I\'ve heard it. It was such a ""landmark"" scene that It\'s even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.As with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn\'t just Pacino and De Niro. It\'s Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on. Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn\'t overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can\'t have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that\'s nitpicking considering the film as a whole.This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing.', ""This is a brilliant film. While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn't a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film's atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary. So all in all, brilliant and absolutely worth it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"", 'A brilliant character driven action thriller with drama and emotion all the way. Despite the long runtime, the pacing never drags. The Magic of this action movie is that you believe the people you see in the screen. You care for them and everything they go through. All of the scenes are influential, the script and the score are iconic. Two thumbs up!', 'A masterpiece and one of the best action heist movies of all time! Heat (1995) is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting, story, score everything in here is excellent!This movie has a great plot, brilliant story about two lead characters a professional master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) battling Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective in this non-stop race against time heist. Michael Mann did everything with this film, he wrote the screenplay, produced this movie and directed it. Michael Mann is a brilliant director I love Miami Vice TV Series, Manhunter and Collateral.This movie is the real heist movie un like Point Break and Baby Driver this movie deserves a 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors and great stunts. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.Al Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna, a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD\'s Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro).Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements, as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling, the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the ""High Incident Bandits"" robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout (as depicted in the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout).Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective was a great character cop. He was at least MILES way better than Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) FBI rookie Agent in Point Break that movie sucked! Lt. Vincent Hanna shoot and killed Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and he saved a child. He cracked the case and he figure it out who the mask robbers were. In the climatic epic battle fight on the end of the film on the airport field he shoot and killed Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). He destroyed and hunt down McCauley\'s crew. True two got away but he always got his man. He at least didn\'t let go McCauley like Johnny Utah did, letting go Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and he did not arrest or shoot or kill any of Bodhi\'s men he let them all go. Lt. Vincent Hanna is a hero and veteran police officer to me.Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), as a professional thief was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. He at least wasn\'t like stupid dumb idiot Bodhi from Point Break, he was trying to get away but he always settle a score with everyone that double crossed him. It is wrong to messing with him. By the end that way leaded him to his end, he made a mistake when he went after Waingro (Kevin Gage).The movie has also one of the greatest shootouts in L.A. in which Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) McCauley (Robert De Niro) firing Colt Model 733 automatic riffle on the cops. Great shootout\'s I love it.The movie has great famous cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Hank Azaria, Martin Ferrero and Xander Berkeley a lot of famous actors and actresses were extra in this movie.The movie focus on a real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal life\'s like you and me. That is why I love this film to death! It is realistic performed and it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life. I love Al Pacino and Robert De Niro\'s performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters.Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass.', ""Wow. First saw this in the cinema back in 1996 and of course we all raved over how good it was but I don't think we really appreciated it back then or could have as twenty somethings.Now I'm late forties this made more sense. That obsession with something at the cost of relationships. McCauley could have been out of there a free man but something in him pulled him another way.In the bible that something comes in the guise of a serpent. That's how subtle it creeps up upon us.Great film."", ""Every 2-3 years i come back to this movie and watch it again and again, just a reminder of the 90's movies with cops and robbers...one of the best cop movie ever!"", ""One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts. The roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, or Bobby Deefield for Pacino. But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best.You can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget. Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director/writer Michael Mann. We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other. DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work. And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job. He's been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department.Mann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat. People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro's gang, Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation. Pacino on his team has Mykel T. Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk.This action film also does not stint on woman's roles. Diane Venora is fine as Pacino's estranged wife. Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro's woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction. Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer's loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson, betray her husband or lose their kid. See how she handles it.Although the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life, Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner. They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy. Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation, the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension. It's like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened.But like in Heat, it should have happened.""]"
6,7,114319,11860.0,"['I was surprised at how good this movie is. A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart. The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don\'t They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.And let\'s just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this. No way could this be anything near as good as the original. And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded. Julia Ormond, who was given Miss Hepburn\'s title role, seemed nothing far removed from ordinary; and Greg Kinnear, who played the playboy David Larrabee, seemed a poor imitation of William Holden. Of course Harrison Ford, I told myself, is another story, since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman, and a fine, accomplished leading man. He would be, I suspected, the lone bright spot. In the original, Humphrey Bogart, a little past his prime, and in not exactly the best of moods, and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn, played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances. Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.He did, but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh, so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be. I mean, Cinderella move over. Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven. It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur\'s daughter than what transpires here.Quickly here\'s the premise of this celluloid fairy tale/romance: Pretty but ordinary Sabrina, born of working class parents, her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees, grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate. She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers, David, who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name. When she comes of age, she goes away to Paris (apparently to work for a fashion magazine: in the original Sabrina, she goes to a cooking school in Paris), picks up confidence and a new kind of eye-popping sophistication, comes back and...well, gets noticed.The basic skeleton of this, the story from the first Sabrina (1954), which is dreamily romantic enough and then some, is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina\'s character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic. Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow\'s end she gets. I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script (trading e-mails perhaps): ""They want romance, they want woman\'s fantasy? They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting? How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome, very rich brothers? She can take her pick. We\'ve give \'em romance, we\'ll give \'em dreams come true!"" And they do. Not only that, but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment, and they do that very cleverly.Of course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Ford--at his best, by the way--and Julia Ormond, a hard-working and talented actress (I recall her from Smilla\'s Sense of Snow, 1997), who knows how to be cute without fawning, supported by Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood and Angie Dickinson. I mention Miss Dickinson because, as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding, she gets to deliver this ""let them eat cake"" line: ""We thought we\'d use recycled paper"" (for the wedding invitations).The script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy. For example, when Sabrina removes her glasses (the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan) after gaining sophistication in Paris, she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein: ""America is my country and Paris is my home."" (Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris, Texas--but that is another film, and besides, I digress...)I also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris would-be lover who kisses her, and--noticing that she is not as engaged as she might me–observes with perfect decorum, ""I\'m embarrassed that you\'re somewhere else.""Memorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt. By the way, he has a number of good lines, and he delivers them well.I especially liked it when he sadly confessed: ""I was sent to deal with you. I sent myself."" It is probably better if you haven\'t seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons. Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez. They really are very different people. And comparing Billy Wilder\'s 1954 film (from the play by Samuel Taylor) is a little like comparing Lon Chaney\'s Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s.Bottom line: see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the business-first character of the ""only surviving heart donor"" very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)', 'Romantic is the word for this movie.  The story, the settings, everything adds up to romantic. And it\'s clean - no gratuitous sex scenes or foul language!  A rarity for a 90s movie.  This movie has a timeless quality to it, and part of the reason is the (again) extremely romantic score!  Many critics panned this version of ""Sabrina"", unfairly comparing it to the original Audrey Hepburn ""Sabrina"".  Nobody could ever compare to Audrey Hepburn, but Julia Ormond is a fine Sabrina in her own right.  She makes the transition from awkward teen to glamorous woman with subtlety and grace. Greg Kinnear shows a natural flair for acting in his first major movie role.', 'I saw the original ""Sabrina"" before ever seeing the remake. I adored Audrey Hepburn in all of her movies, and this was not an exception. Her comedic timing was perfect. She was completely believable as a young ingenue, and of course, she would not be Audrey Hepburn if she weren\'t absolutely breakthtaking on screen. But while I enjoyed the original, I have seen it only once, whereas I have seen the remake so many times I have lost count! The 1995 ""Sabrina"" is a gem of a film. I keep hearing myself describe it as funny, but sometimes I wonder if that\'s even the right word. That\'s because except for that rather unexpected burst of laughter from Linus\' secretary, which cracks me up EVERY time I get to that part, I have never found myself laughing aloud while watching this movie. But the humor is so cleverly written, it is impossible to ignore just how charming and comical this movie is.The script is wonderfully brought to life by the outstanding cast. Harrison Ford is superb as Linus Larrabee. He plays Linus as a serious and almost ruthless businessman, and yet gains our sympathy as he gradually shows a tender and vulnerable side to Linus\' cool exterior. Greg Kinnear is well-cast as Linus\' dish of a younger brother, David. True, David is self-centered, careless, and carefree. But Greg Kinnear plays him with utter charm that we understand why Sabrina and women in general are so taken with him. And what of Julia Ormond? Well, I think she was absolutely perfect as Sabrina. If she had felt any trepidation essaying the role that had been so closely identified with an icon like Audrey Hepburn, none of her nerves translated on to the screen. She IS Sabrina. I think it\'s a wonderful combination of her beauty and acting skills that helped her succeed in this role. The sincerity of her performance makes Sabrina so appealing and completely lovable.The performances of the three leads are complemented by a fine supporting cast made up of John Wood, Nancy Marchand, Dana Ivey, Richard Crenna, and Angie Dickinson. Some of the film\'s funniest moments involve their characters. And then there is the exquisite soundtrack composed by John Williams. The score is at once dreamy and intoxicating. Two songs that were written for the movie, ""(In the) Moonlight"" and ""How Can I Remember?"", are just as memorable and perfectly capture the feelings of romance and longing.Hollywood has made a number of successful romantic movies, and I think ""Sabrina"" ranks as one of its best. Its charm never wears off. It sweeps you off your feet and makes your heart soar. It is a marvelous, marvelous film!', 'I really liked this film. The acting, the music, the dialogue, the gorgeous scenes of Paris and New England, and the glamourous parties. Julia Ormond is no Audrey Hepburn, but who is? I think she hit all the right notes as the shy, clumsy girl who goes away, blossoms, and comes home confident and glamourous. Ormond\'s Sabrina never loses her innocence or her good heart. Greg Kinnear was hilarious as the lovable ladies\' man (and looks a lot like William Holden in the original). Nancy Marchand was hysterically funny as the crabby Mrs. Larabee, and John Wood turned in a good performance as Sabrina\'s father.But I did have a harder time with Harrison Ford\'s Linus. He seemed too dark and too greedy to buy as loving Sabrina, even when he called off the merger. It always seemed to ring false in a way. He seemed a lot like the character of Richard in ""Caroline in the City"". But I regress. This is a very good movie!', '1995 saw the release of a great American romantic comedy in Hollywood tradition, ""The American president"", but it\'s Pollack\'s ""Sabrina"" that deserves the title because it\'s based on the 1954\' classic, directed by Billy Wilder and starring Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. Yet, there\'s more in ""Sabrina"" than a simple remake.There is a natural reflex from every movie buff, which is to prefer any ""original"" film to its remake. It often has to do with the classic status reached by the first movie, inevitably dismissing any attempt to remake it. But at the risk of sounding like another heretic, I thought Sydney Pollack\'s remake, if not better, is a solid match to the original acting-wise and more than anything, storytelling-wise.I insist on the storytelling department because it contradicts the idea of the original\'s greatness relying on its monumental cast, incomparable to the Sidney Pollack, Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear and Julia Osmond\'s quartet. Yet ""Sabrina"" approaches the two myths of Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling and ask for us to root for Sabrina, a woman who never attracted men, yet ended up being in the middle of a business scheme, until winning the heart of a businessman. No matter how fairytale, the material is, its convincingness is not to be taken for granted, and no matter how great are the actors, their transformation, their chemistry is still something that depend on the storytelling, more than the acting.And it\'s extraordinary how Pollack not only remains faithful to the fairytale aspect of the story and to the sensitivities of the 90\'s in the same time, starting with the heroine herself. Sabrina is supposed to be the Ugly Duckling, she\'s the chauffeur\'s daughter who spent most of her time in David\'s shadow, before finding herself during her trip in Paris. The problem with Audrey Hepburn is that she was incapable of being unattractive no matter how hard she, or the make-up and costume design, tried. Julia Osmond, on the other hand, being that unknown brunette with the same sweet charm as Juliette Binoche, with small glasses and long hair, is convincing as the not-too attractive girl on the surface.And the new script doesn\'t insult our intelligence by labeling her as a \'dog\', she\'s just a shy, insecure person who had to discover her inner attractiveness before ever trying to seducing. And the Paris\' transformation give much more depth and consistence to her evolution, when she comes back, we know Sabrina hasn\'t turned into a glamorous woman but as a confident one. Paris\' effect is really palpable and makes it strangely believable that David wouldn\'t recognize Sabrina. I\'m not saying that these details hurt the original film, but Pollack, probably moved by a humble desire to pay tribute to the \'untouchable\' classic, compensated the modest cast through a particular attention to human details, that inevitably highlighted the original\'s flaws.And the real masterstroke comes with the casting of Harrison Ford as Linus. Ford exudes the perfect mix of seriousness and vulnerability. He easily passes as a grown-up man who spent so much behind the office that someone had to show him the preciousness of life, and how it can\'t afford to be wasted. And all through his interactions with Sabrina, we keep on wondering if he\'s aware that he\'s falling in love, and if it\'s reciprocal. Both Linus and Sabrina are part of a hypocrisy that betray an endearing defenselessness, and makes them two persons ironically fitting one another. And while Pollack could have kept the movie\'s track and bring David to make the deal possible, he also develops his seemingly one-dimensional personality.I liked Holden in ""Sabrina"", and his chemistry with Hepburn was so sincere it really veiled any hint of sentiment toward the elderly Bogart. But Holden\'s shining moment when he accepts to marry his fiancée almost felt like a deus-ex-machina. How could David finally give Sabrina up so eagerly? Well, Pollack gave me satisfying answers by making David grow up in maturity, by taken into consideration that his character\'s arc had to be closed by the fact that for the first time, he\'ll allow his brother to live his life. And strangely, the romantic comedy, also turns into a subtle and positive satire about family relationships in business, allowing Nancy Marchand to shine as the authoritarian, yet compassionate mother.What I admire most in the remake is Pollack\'s attachment to make the story more believable and endearing by today\'s standards, he knows he won\'t reach the same legendary status as the original, but he knows that this very status asks for believability. His characters are extremely well-developed, he gives a spectacular supporting cast to his movies, and the whole film is such a delight to watch, that nothing could have ruined it. The ending was the only hit-or-miss, and while I thought the hug between Hepburn and Bogart was awkward, just a kiss in Paris wouldn\'t have been enough to ruin the whole efforts.But I wasn\'t surprised, that Linus would apologize to Sabrina, considering the scene where he broke her heart, a scene whose emotionality clearly surpasses the original. I loved that he asked for her help, because he needed her, and in return open her heart on how much she needs him. That\'s what I call, a beautiful romance, comedic or not, it was the perfect conclusion for a movie that had so much to prove to be respected, and that even managed to be superior to the original film, and it\'s one of the rare instances where I\'m not hesitant to give it a higher rating.It doesn\'t diminish the classic status of Billy Wilder\'s ""Sabrina"", Julia Osmond is not Audrey Hepburn, and Harrison Ford isn\'t Bogart, but like I said for the previous film, good ingredient don\'t necessarily make a good meal, what matters is how the director makes his interactions believable and emotionally appealing. And Pollack brilliantly succeeds in both exercises.', 'Tempting though it may be to compare this film to the 1954 version, you will miss the point if you do. To understand the true magic of Sydney Pollack\'s masterpiece, read the Samuel A. Taylor play both films were based on. While I\'m sure the play was a great evening out at the theater between martinis in the 1950s, it\'s somewhat incredible that two film versions so profoundly translated this lightweight romantic comedy, each in its own time.In 1954, Billy Wilder used an incredible cast to entertain. No, Bogart should never have been cast. Cary Grant might have created the dynamic relationship with Audrey Hepburn we fortunately got to see later in Charade, but if Bogart had not been cast would the film hold its classic status? Hepburn transfixed an audience and brought to the world La Vie en Rose. William Holden is period eye candy, and the film will always be fun.Forty years later, however, Pollack made an important film. Taylor\'s play is, after all, just a fairy tale, and this film fully realizes it. Ormond is enchanting. Kinnear ripens the always empty David. Fanny Ardant brings a french cinema quality to the film\'s Paris episodes. Marchand\'s ""I didn\'t teach you this"" culminates what may be one of the best written scenes in American film. You can watch this scene over and over and each time gain a better understanding of how great acting can define a relationship, this one between mother and son, for an audience.But this film should have been called Linus. Harrison Ford\'s tour de force performance as the greater Larrabee fulfills Pollack\'s mission to tell a simple story of how a king is transformed by the love of a woman.""It was a lie, then it was a dream.""', 'The temptation to compare it with the 1954 version is not small. And it is a good thing because the film has the force to use its voice. Julia Ormond is realy Sabrina. And Harrison Ford is a revelation as Linus. But, for me, the authetic good points are Miriam Colon as lovely Rosa and Nancy Marchand as wise,fascinating Maude Larrabee. Short, a seductive film.', 'Comparisons are hardly ever fair, yet people insist on making them. DON\'T compare this film to the original. Who cares? Judge it on it\'s own merits, and you\'ll come up with a winner. The interaction between the players is seamless. The dialog is witty, intelligent, at times touching, and always believable.This ""Sabrina"" is a delight. A truly classic romantic comedy in the finest sense of the word. Harrison Ford portrays Linus Larrabee, perfectly blending ruthless billionaire and socially awkward male. Flawless in business matters, he\'s out of his element and totally unprepared for the consequences of what he originally deems a simple matter, turning Sabrina Fairchild\'s interest to himself instead of brother David (Greg Kinnear), thereby saving both an impending marriage and lucrative corporate merger.Julia Ormond\'s Sabrina is just the right mixture of sophistication and innocence. Daughter of the Larrabee\'s chauffeur, she\'s grown up on the family estate, yet outside of their social circle, of course. Passionately in love with youngest son David Larrabee, we see her in the movie\'s opening moments hard at her favorite pastime, spying on David and fantasizing that she is the girl he\'s currently schmoozing at mother Maude\'s annual birthday bash. Her father, Thomas Fairchild (John Wood) in an effort to broaden her horizons and get her past this obsession with David, arranges with Maude (Nancy Marchand) to send Sabrina to Paris for a year. He hopes she will learn about life and independence while working in the Paris offices of Vogue.While Sabrina is away, David meets beautiful Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), up and coming pediatrician. Coincidentally, she is the daughter of Patrick Tyson (Richard Crenna), owner of Tyson Electronics, a high technology firm that Linus has had his eye on for some time. As his brother\'s relationship blossoms, Linus quietly begins buying up Tyson stock.To Linus, everything seems to be proceeding as it should be. David and Elizabeth have finally set a date. He and Patrick Tyson are in serious merger negotiations. Maude and Ingrid Tyson (Angie Dickenson) are planning their children\'s monster wedding. All is about to change, however. A year has passed. Once again, Maude\'s birthday party approaches. It\'s also time for Sabrina to come home.Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job, mixing just the right recipe of romance and comedy throughout. We, the audience, are just as stunned as the movie\'s characters at the ""new"" Sabrina. With a Parisian haircut, in chic black with enormous sunglasses, she is nearly as unrecognizable to us as she obviously is to David. In town to pick up a gift for his mother, David, ever the playboy, offers what he clearly sees as an incredibly hot girl a lift home. He has no idea it\'s Sabrina, and she exacts a small measure of delicious revenge during the ride, watching him squirm uncomfortably as he tries vainly to remember who she is.To make amends and intrigued by the mystery, David invites her to ""his house"" for a drink. She accepts gleefully. The charade continues until they arrive at the Larrabee estate (quite a bit of which was filmed at the Harrison Conference Center in Glen Cove, NY), whereupon Linus instantly recognizes her and welcomes her home.Linus, who never misses much, also sees trouble. Big trouble, judging by the smitten look on his brother\'s face. Thomas Fairchild, in turn, watching his daughter steam out a dress for Maude\'s party, doesn\'t like it much either. This was not at all what he had planned when he sent her to Paris.The night of Maude\'s party arrives, complete with a live band, perfect weather (""It never rained on a Larrabee party. The Larrabee\'s wouldn\'t have allowed it...""), and, this time, as an invited guest, Sabrina.Admittedly, there are many actresses on screen today for whom the word ""beautiful"" is but a pale description. Even so, I would put Ormand\'s Sabrina on the party\'s walkway as one of the most incredibly stunning appearances of all time. She is, literally, breathtaking. And David, to the panicked concern of his mother and brother, is done when he sees her. Finished. Forget Elizabeth. Forget the impending marriage. He sees nothing but Sabrina, while Maude and Linus see a billion dollar merger about to go into the tank.That\'s enough plot synopsis. Suffice it to say that Linus and Maude decide to get David out of the way while Linus puts right what is going terribly wrong. You\'ll have to watch the rest of this charming film to see how it all turns out.The casting is first class. Besides Ford and Ormond, Nancy Marchand\'s Maude is acerbically intelligent, blending wealthy arrogance (Can\'t we SEND somebody?"") and human compassion for Sabrina, with a deep love, and intimate knowledge of the psychology of her two sons. Greg Kinnear shines as the lovably lazy David, who works hardest at doing nothing productive. Lauren Holly\'s Elizabeth is the perfect opposite.The supporting players are no less capable in their respective roles. John Wood is always elegant as the quintessential chauffeur and loving father. It brought a smile to see Crenna and Dickenson together again as the Tysons, and veteran character actress Dana Ivey is a gem as Mack, Linus\' watchdog assistant (But he PAYS me to tell him...""). Some of the movie\'s best scenes are with the remainder of the ensemble cast in the servant\'s kitchen, particularly those with Rosa (Miriam Colon).So, in conclusion, I emphatically urge you to rent, or better still, buy this film. Though the Bogart/Hepburn purists will probably flame me into oblivion, I\'m sure you\'ll find it entertaining, heartwarming, and absolutely leisure time well spent!', 'SABRINA, in my opinion, is a sweet, heartwarming, and charming romance with terrific performances. If you ask me, the way that Sabrina (Julia Ormond) and David (Greg Kinnear) met up again after several years was very romantic. It was also really funny when a ménage à trois began after Linus (Harrison Ford) fell for her, too. As far as I can see, this movie had terrific performances, excellent direction, perfect casting, and nice scenery, especially for a movie set in New York. Oh, yes, the Paris scenery was especially lovely. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, or Greg Kinnear, you should definitely see this movie. Prepare for lots of charm, wit, laughs, and romance when you see it.']"
7,8,112302,45325.0,"[""We all know the story. There have been some pretty good Tom Sawyer movies made. This one capitalizes on star power for an audience that probably has never heard of the principle character. Putting these motives aside, it just doesn't work the best. While Jonathan Taylor Thomas is an adequate Tom, Brad Renfro is not a very good Huck. He is too much of a pretty boy. He is much too bright, though his character tries to make him otherwise. If you've read Twain, you know that he is tremendously superstitious and has really rough edges, both mentally and physically. He is kind of whiny in this movie. Becky Thatcher looks to be about 25 years old and stands next to Tom like a giant. She pushes him around and dominates. Obviously, the director decided to make her an attractive character to young women. That's not bad, but it betrays the spirit of the period in which it was written. They should at least have looked about the same age. There are good scenes. The graveyard scene is well done. Injun Joe is threatening and murderous. The funeral scene is a disappointment. It needed to be milked a bit. Some of the peripheral characters could have been more developed. The conclusion works OK. However, it needed a dose of truth and believability to carry it through. See it, but don't expect a lot."", 'Spoiler warning! This is a mixed-bag when it comes to story-telling.  Some scenes work quite well, others are totally poor. One of the weakest is the famous ""engagement"" scene.  It is thrown away as a totally one-note sentimental piece, and misses the comic potential of the scene. The version of TOM SAWYER starring Johnny Whittaker and Jodie Foster delivered it a lot better. Brad Renfro does a technically brilliant performance here.  He can obviously relate to Huck very well and there is obviously some parallels with his own life.  Unfortunately, he doesn\'t suit Huck as a classic story character, and he certainly doesn\'t suit the style of the rest of this movie.  The effect is like Robert DeNiro doing his TAXI DRIVER role in the middle of a Laurel & Hardy comedy.  It takes a lot of skill to make these styles fit together, and it\'s certainly out of the league of the production of this film. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is fairly good as Tom.  He does the climactic court scene very well, and he is generally charming and mischevious.  But he lacks the depth to make the character really come alive.  The whitewashing scene is fairly good, though I\'ve seen better. Not bad, but certainly no classic.  The previous film THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN is actually a far better adaptation of a famous Twain novel.', 'There are things that Tom and Huck does do right. The three best things about it are the production values, the score and Eric Schweig as Injun Joe. The film looks very pretty with quite evocative costumes and sets, while the score is both memorable and relaxing. Schweig is perfect as Injun Joe and genuinely menacing, though the writers perhaps go a little overboard with the villainous and somewhat violent side to him. Brad Renfro does do well as Huck, the character does come across as too sullen and hard but Renfro is suitably mischievous and brings some fun amongst bringing out a somewhat conflicted side to Huck. There are some effective scenes, the graveyard scene is very atmospheric and the moment when Injun Joe starts to stir/stirs when Tom is reaching for the map sends chills up the spine. The whitewashing scene is very charming as well. There are some mixed feelings assets here. Jonathan Taylor Thomas(of whom Tom and Huck is like a vehicle for him early in his career) makes for a spirited Tom but the more dramatic moments(the courtroom scene is quite good though) show signs of inexperience. Peter Hewitt\'s filmography has been hit and miss, Tom and Huck is one of his better films and thankfully is not another Zoom or Thunderpants but his best film will always be Bill and Ted\'s Bogus Journey(that and The Borrowers, of the films I\'ve seen so far of his, are the only ones that have ratings better than decent). Tom and Huck does have its failings though, the worst case was the grossly out-of-kilter way Becky was written, if there is a more selfish and bitchy Becky on any film adaptation of Tom Sawyer it\'s yet to be seen and Rachael Leigh Cook while attractive does come across as forced and stereotypical-teen-like in her acting. There are some fun moments injected in the more nostalgic and charming moments seen in the first half but the second half, where it\'s all suspense thriller and Injun Joe on the rampage feels like a different film altogether, the two halves just juxtapose too much. The crucial scenes are there even when the adaptation is quite loose but the heart is lacking. The funeral scene falls flat being very under-characterised and rushed through, and the ""engagement"" scene came across as overly-sentimental(an attempt by Disney to make the story more timely) and awkward as well. The worst bit of dialogue was Becky\'s ""What? I\'m not the first? I hope you die"", not only is it a terrible and shallow thing to say in the first place but it is something that Becky would never dream of saying. Much of the dialogue is weak, not just that line from Becky but the whole style is not very nuanced and it feels at times too modern. Little attempt also is made to bringing Missouri\'s dialect, language and how they speak, the production values did a great job in being evocative, why didn\'t the writing make an effort too? And this is coming from someone to makes a big effort in judging films/TV series/literary adaptations on their own terms. Other than Huck, Injun Joe and to a lesser extent Tom, the rest of the actors suffer from their characters being underdeveloped and don\'t register as a result really. To conclude, Tom and Huck is alright as a film though with many problems but along with the Soviet film(with the bad dubbing, pacing and editing) it is one of the weaker adaptations of a great book. 5/10 Bethany Cox', ""Tom Sawyer (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) runs away and is rescued by Huck Finn (Brad Renfro). They see Injun Joe and Muff Potter digging up the grave of Vic 'One-Eyed' Murrell to retrieve a treasure map for Doctor Robinson. Injun Joe murders Doc Robinson with Muff's knife. Muff is arrested for the murder. Tom is torn between an oath to Huck and his need to exonerate an innocent man.The production looks weak. This Disney doesn't have the needed edge and doesn't even have Disney money. The story has too many killings to be a kiddie movie. The movie doesn't have the grittiness to feel real. Jonathan Taylor Thomas used to be a thing back in the day. He's cute with a twinkle in his eye. I don't lay too much on him. He just doesn't have the toughness unlike Brad Renfro. Rachael Leigh Cook is a cutie in this one. This movie's tone is all over the place."", 'This version of the classic novel by Mark Twain makes a nice little movie, but fails to capture the humorous spirit of the book. Many hilarious scenes are missing and the writers have taken too many liberties with the plot.Jonathan Taylor Thomas is wonderful as Tom Sawyer. Unfortunately his charm does not last until the very end of the movie, but seems to fade after a while. It might possibly have something to do with the fact, that, even though this movie is based on ""The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer"", it\'s actually Huck\'s character that steals the whole show.I had a bit of a problem with the way Huck Finn was portrayed in this movie. Of course Brad Renfro is a fantastic actor (his performance is probably the best thing about this film) and he manages to give Huck Finn many tragic and deep aspects. Unfortunately Mark Twain\'s Huck Finn is neither tragic or very deep. One can only wonder why Huck has been made the brooding hero, when it\'s actually Tom Sawyer, who is supposed to be the brightest star in this story.Despite the many sugar-coated scenes and the fact that both Tom and Huck are a bit out-of-character, this movie is still something worth seeing. Injun Joe and Muff Potter are both realistic and Rachael Leigh Cook makes a brilliant and not-so-girly Becky Thatcher! The sets and wardrobe look very authentic, but they alone are not enough to bring the evergreen story wholly alive.', 'A mischievous young boy, Tom Sawyer (Jonathan Taylor Thomas),witnesses a murder by the deadly Injun Joe. Tom becomes friends with Huckleberry Finn (Brad Renfro), a boy with no future and no family.Going through the Top 250 lists from various years, somehow this ended up on the list for 1996. Of all the lists from 1996 through 2014, this first list is the most bizarre. Others have films that clearly do not belong, but none more than the 1996 list. And this is a prime example. How did a film that barely ranks above 5 out of 10 manage to be considered one of the best of all time? Not that this is a bad film. As far as kid stories go, it is alright, and not the worst introduction to the world of Mark Twain. But it is clearly not intended to be a masterpiece, but more like something one might see on the Hallmark channel. Just a showcase for the now-forgotten Jonathan Taylor Thomas.', 'Oh, where to begin with this movie. I\'ll start with some of the good: Eric Schweig was perfectly cast as the murderous, intimidating, menacing Injun Joe. If I could create my own Tom Sawyer classic movie, I\'d recast him. Same with Michael McShane as Muff Potter. Jonathan Taylor Thomas sounds like the perfect Tom Sawyer on paper; he does have a history of playing rambunctious, trouble-making boys, and he has a special place in my heart as Simba from The Lion King, my favorite Disney movie. But here...he\'s just alright. He doesn\'t have as much of the edge that made Tom Sawyer such a fascinating, dynamic character. Most of the blame for that goes to the writers though; I\'m sure Thomas would have done much better had he been given better material to work with. Everyone else was sorely miscast (i.e Huckleberry Finn, Becky Thatcher, Aunt Polly, Widow Douglas, Joe Harper, etc.), and the characters who did have decent casting (Judge Thatcher, Ben Rogers, Mr. Dobbins, etc.) didn\'t stand out very much.No attempt was made to create the atmosphere of Tom Sawyer (the dialect, the plot, the setting, the characters, etc.) Every boy, including Tom Sawyer, went barefoot in the book, but in the movie they all wore shoes. This may not seem like a big deal, but it\'s part of the edge Tom Sawyer and his friends have in the book; they\'re not afraid to get down and dirty in the adventures they have, and the boys who do wear shoes in the book are looked down upon as sissies.Huckleberry Finn in the books was carefree, laid-back, and is satisfied with his independent lifestyle. Although he is despised by every ""respectable"" adult in St. Petersburg, he\'s envied and friends with most of the children, and he doesn\'t feel sorry for himself. Brad Renfro\'s Huck is snide, irritable, sarcastic, and even somewhat of a bully, nothing at all like Twain\'s Huck. This Huck DOES feel sorry for himself, and often takes his frustrations out on Tom.Becky Thatcher in the book is a bit too demure and puts on airs. But she isn\'t a bitch. In the book, Tom gets back into her good graces by taking the hit for her (literally) and their relationship grows even stronger in the cave scene. In the movie, she\'s portrayed as a bitch plain and simple; in fact she holds a continuous grudge against Tom throughout the movie, which makes their bonding in the cave scene really forced. Not to mention that Rachael Leigh Cook as Becky Thatcher is probably the worst case of miscasting in this movie; she was way too old and was a good two heads taller than Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Disney could have made their own version of Tom Sawyer great, especially with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the lead. What a wasted, missed opportunity.', ""It's an awful presentation, the original tale isn't much better - who do these injuns think they are acting as if they own the place. Curious that Mark Twain didn't use someone of white western European descent for his antagonist. Sadly makes this and him a statue that belongs in a museum."", 'It may not be exactly like the book but its really good movie. Jonathan Tayler Thomas really always looked to me as the real Tom Sawyer just something about him as TOm fits it to a T. Got some funny characters and Muff seems realistic to me believeable when hes about to die Injun Joe looks terrifying if was around him like hes some insane killer. The very look of him when hes like stick me i mean if a kid dang id be scared too. Huck plays his part well makes him believeable there is other tom and sawyers that been out that follow the book this is just follows it some and makes ire ally good i dont know the down hate on it gesh there is real movies that are bad in every line. But this is fun cool and everyone i think fit it i have the movie and i love it.']"
8,9,114576,9091.0,"['I found this to be a very interesting action with with Powers Boothe fun to watch as the main villain, thanks to his dialog and no-nonsense approach. At least he wasn\'t one of those talk-first, shoot-maybe-later clichés from the world of film. The hockey scenes in here are realistic, too. However, the rest of the film doesn\'t exactly exhibit realism: lots of hokey stuff in here, too. At the end, the action really gets carried away and brings the rating down on this to a manageable ""7."" Otherwise, it would be a minimum of ""8"" just for the entertainment value alone.After a slow start, it picks up when Boothe enters the movie. Then it never lets up. If you want a pure hour of action, this is it. There is no female lead in this movie, so you get no romance nor gratuitous sex scenes, which is a bit unusual. It\'s a straight crime story.One note: unless things have been changed, I was disappointed my DVD did not offer a widescreen version.', 'After the success of ""Die Hard"" there have been many movie clones of that great action film. There was ""Die Hard on a Ship"" (""Under Siege""), ""Die Hard on a Train"" (""Under Siege 2""), and ""Die Hard on a Bus"" (""Speed""), just to name a few. ""Sudden Death"" can be described as either ""Die Hard on the Ice"", ""Die Hard at a Hockey Game"" or ""Die Hard in an Arena"". You pick. Technically you could put all three titles into this movie and it\'ll still be pretty much the same thing. However, ""Sudden Death"" is one of the better ""Die Hard"" clones. It\'s an exciting movie about terrorists taking over the Pittsburgh Civic Arena where the decisive seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Chicago Blackhawks is being played. However there\'s a little difference here. The only people who know that hostages have taken over are the people in the VIP box (which includes the Vice President), the Secret Service men outside the arena, and an arena fire marshall who\'s two little kids are attending the game. The 17,000-plus fans attending the game have no idea whats really going on. That fire marshall is played by Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. I\'ve not been a big fan of Van Damme\'s films, but ""Sudden Death"" is easily his best movie to date. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, the fire marshall who finds out something\'s wrong when his little daughter is taken to the VIP box as a hostage after witnessing a killing. When McCord finds out what\'s going on, he does precisely what Bruce Willis did in ""Die Hard"", takes on the terrorists all by himself. The lead bad guy is portrayed by Powers Boothe in a frightening performance. He may not be quite as effective as Alan Rickman\'s villain in ""Die Hard"", but Boothe does a good job at being mean. Van Damme is also very good too (especially in one scene where he poses as the Penguins goalie to hide out from the bad guys who were chasing him). He\'s much better here than he was in ""Timecop"", teaming again with ""Timecop"" director Peter Hyams. The action scenes are splendid (both the gunplay and the action during the game), and the suspense has you on the edge. ""Sudden Death"" has a few silly moments here and there, but since this movie is such a good thrill ride, you won\'t care. This movie deserved to be a big hit at the box office and wasn\'t. I\'ll never understand why.***1/2 (out of four)', ""Darren(Jean Claude Van Damme) is a firemen, he carries his sons to a Pittsburgh Penguin national Hockey play-off where is taking place the final.But the arena has been taken by a terrorists led by a cruel villain(Powers Boothe). The bad guys are holding the Vice President(Raymond J. Barry), as well as another authorities taken as hostages in a private box. The chief villain demanding a few billion dollars or he'll blow up the stadium because is wired with enough explosives for killing all around. Meanwhile an Inspector(Dorian Harewood) is also investigating the events and is captured our hero's daughter .This film is plenty of action and explosions and is quite amusing. Displays suspense, thriller, violence, great action scenes and stunts with sensational scenes. Jean Claude Van Damme gets a perfect part who plays cat-and-mouse- with a sardonic nasty, well played by Powers Boothe.The highlights film are the impressive fighting on the stadium's ceiling. The blowing up ,pyrotechnics,struggles are breathtaking but the picture is just another usual Hollywood product in the wake of ¨Die hard¨.Married only by lack credulity for feats of Van Damme and too many needlessly scenes. It packs a high budget and lavishly produced ,however, nowadays Van Damme performs a middling and low budget movies. Spectacular music score fitting to action film by John Debney(Sin city,Passion of Christ).The motion picture is professionally directed by Peter Hyams who repeats with Jean Claude in ¨Timecop¨ . He's an irregular director with hits(Relic,Outland,Capricorn one) and flops(Sound and thunder,End of days)."", ""Darren McCord, a fire safety officer at a hockey stadium, takes his two kids to a major Pittsburgh Penguins game. It just so happens to be the day that extortionist/thieves kidnap the vice president and hold him hostage at the stadium, thus putting himself and his children in mortal danger.Lets cut to the chase here, Sudden Death is a clone rip off of Die Hard, the action template movie that shines as bright as a newly formed bruise, but as copycats go {and there have been reams}, Peter Hyams' beefcake blunderbuss movie is an action junkie's delight. Jean Claude Van Damme {McCord obviously} flexes his muscles and not only beats seven bells of tar out of Powers Booth's criminal minions, he also proves to be a hero and loving father to his oblivious children. It's contrived for sure, I mean we get Jean sneaking on to the ice and taking up net minding duties, and it's certainly a script devoid of imagination. But it's got Van Damme fighting a hot kick ass babe in a penguin suit and a last fifteen minutes of high roof/dangling/swinging/exploding mayhem that does the action genre proud.It's no Die Hard, but what genre films are? Sudden Death in spite of its contrivances, is a film that is impossible not to enjoy if you are a like minded adult. 7/10"", 'If you live anywhere other than Pittsburgh, this movie - much like Striking Distance - is a DVD that you can find in the $1 section. Here, it\'s a prized commodity, a remembrance of the Steel City in the 1990\'s and a time when the owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins\' wife decided that she wanted to make a movie.That\'s right - Howard Baldwin, chairman of the Pittsburgh Penguins, was one of the film\'s backers. The goal was to use the home opened between the Pens and the Chicago Blackhawks as a backdrop, but there was a lockout due to the owners and players not coming to terms. That meant that an exhibition game between the two teams didn\'t have the intensity that the filmmakers wanted, so they got the minor league Johnstown Chiefs and Wheeling Thunderbirds to play in front of 3,000 extras, with the rest of the crowd being cardboard cutouts. Seriously - look for the fake fans.Darren McCord (Van Damme!) may be French Canadian, but he\'s a true Yinzer. Once, he was a firefighter but he was unable to save a young girl from a house fire. He lost his wife and barely sees his family, who live in a nice house up on Mt. Washington while he\'s probably living in Carrick or Brookline (I\'m trying to make this review so Pittsburgh-centric that it will only appear as blips and bleeps to anyone outside of Allegheny County).Now he\'s the fire marshall for the Civic Arena - long gone for the several times renamed PPG Paints Arena - and finds himself in the midst of a terrorist situation when former CIA agent Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe, who played Jim Jones in the made for TV movie Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones) wires the Igloo up with explosives and takes the Vice-President hostage.Yes, this is a movie directly tied into the end of a hockey game causing bombs to blow up an ice hockey arena. A film where JCVD does battle with the Pens\' penguin mascot, Iceburgh. Where even supposed good guys are really on the side of evil. And where Van Damme can create homemade flamethrowers and even get on the ice himself to save the day.If you\'re a fan of 1990\'s hockey, this is the film for you. Jay Caufield, Mario Lemieux and Luc Robitaille, as does venerable Pens announcer Mike Lange, who is one of the few announcers left who isn\'t some vanilla pretty boy who barely knows the game. Instead, he\'s given to loudly shouted Lange-isms like ""She wants to sell my monkey!"" and ""Get in the fast lane, grandma! This bingo game is ready to roll!"" You can hear his signature ""It\'s a hockey night in Pittsburgh!"" call in this film as well. Not to brag, but of all the names in my phone, the fact that I have Lange\'s makes me probably the happiest (we worked together on several radio commercials).Director Peter Hyams has an interesting IMDB list, working on films like Capricorn One, The Star Chamber, 2010, Outland, Running Scared, The Presidio, Stay Tuned and Timecop before this one. He\'d go on to make The Relic - a film I was asked to quiet down during my laugh-filled viewing of it at Mann\'s Chinese Theater - and End of Days. He elevates this above it being just another Die Hard clone.You know who else does? Powers Boothe. He\'s one of the best bad guys ever here. And to top it all off, he read the audio book of the film. This is the holy grail here in Pittsburgh, a valuable artifact worth its weight in pierogies.', 'I may be one of those movie buffs who\'s at least willing to confess that they\'re not a huge admirer or fan of a certain actor or director. Jean-Claude Van Damme would be near the top of my list of actors that I only admire although I\'ve seen a few films where he has his name is on the poster.""Sudden Death"" is the second film that Van Damme has starred in with photographer/director Peter Hyams (""End of Days"", ""Timecop"") is at the helm.This film was based on an actual story by Karen Baldwin and is adapted into the story by Gene Quintano.The movie takes place at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh where the Chicago Blackhawks and the Pittsburgh Penquins are about to take the ice for the last game of the Stanley Cup finals.  Van Damme\'s character, Darren McCord, takes his son and daughter to the game.  As usual, the arena is packed with fans and the Vice President of the U.S. has come to see the game as well.  Unfortunately, Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe), a demented terrorist and a small band of terrorists take control of the Owner\'s box where the V.P. and several people.  Foss demands that he wants a billion dollars and how he wants to use it puzzles me.  However, at the end of each period, if his demand isn\'t met, Foss shoots someone and if the deal isn\'t done at the end of the game.  The arena is blown sky high with several explosives that are set all over the arena.Boothe is good here and he makes the threat very real, which is key to making any thriller.  He also shows some wit and in one particular scene, the Vice President curiously asks Foss ""What kind of lunatic are you?"" Foss responds - ""The best kind.""What draws McCord into the situation is when his daughter is taken up to the Owner\'s box.  From there on, the movie manages to make the excitement to be interesting.  One example would be the fight scenes that McCord has with a couple of thugs in the kitchen at two seperate times.  Just about every prop is used from the meat slicer to the bone, which goes through one of the neck of a terrorist.  Fun and yucky isn\'t it?The last half of the film is just about entertaining as the first half is.  I\'m undecided if ""Sudden Death"" would make the best thriller that involves a sports event and terrorists since John Frankenheimer\'s ""Black Sunday"".  Van Damme and Boothe are both good here.', ""Since one of my favorite action star of this generation, Michael Jai White want to make an unofficial sequel to a 90s Die Hard scenario movie called Sudden Death staring the great Jean Claude Van Damme so naturally as a fan of Van Damme and all the Die Hard clone movies no matter how bad or low budget they are I'm quite excited to finally watch this movie for the first time ever and although its not quite awesome like I anticipated it still quite a treat tbh. Because there nothing original in this movie except the hockey stadium setting so all of my attention is on how good Van Damme carry this movie and needless to say, he does that pretty well with many unique ways to kill the bad guys especially the hilarious and definitely in my top 10 favorite Van Damme action sequences where he battles a villain in a mascot costume."", ""Sudden Death just might be Jean-Claude Van Damme's best movie to date along with Hard Target,Bloodsport,Lionheart,and Cyborg!Powers Boothe is great and there is always action,great fights and interesting moments in the film!The film is very satisfying and entertaining and recommend for big time action fans!"", ""Van-Damme is known for acting in two film genres: Action and Martial-Arts.

James Bond 007 action film the best one that was ever made. In my opinion it is the best one I love this movie to death! I grew up watching it as a child and Pierce Brosnan is my number 1 favorite James Bond. GoldenEye is the first film to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.I\'m a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we\'ve seen to IAN FLEMING\'s James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get\'s bored. It is a beautiful movie, with beautiful direction from Martin Campbell. The stunts are completely insane in scale in this movie and really dangerous.Music score is by Éric Serra, the title song is GoldenEye performed by Tina Turner. GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond: Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.Style and sophistication are in abundance - - ""The name\'s Bond. James Bond."" Goldeneye\'s female characters are honestly beautiful with particular techniques. The bad one is Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), an ex-Soviet fighter pilot who tranquilly smokes big cigars and knocks off her victims with her \'killer thighs.\' In one scene, she challenges Bond\'s legendary Aston Martin DB5 to a wild road race outside Monte Carlo with her red Ferrari: in another she was so smart that she snatches a top-secret helicopter from under the noses of the French navy. Izabella Scorupco is a great and the finest Bond girl, the irresistible Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) who \'tastes like strawberries.\' Natalya possesses all the technical ability to neutralize Janus\' scheme or to destroy all computer records with the GoldenEye As one who survived a mass murder, this lovely beauty is suddenly a marked woman.James Bond investigates the theft of the control disk for the GoldenEye satellite. His investigation leads to an organization of arms dealers Janus and the reappearance of someone from Bond\'s past. James Bond must deal with betrayal of his old friend Alec Trevelyan (006) gone rogue, from using a satellite GoldenEye against London to cause a global financial meltdownWhy I also love this movie to death beside the action is because of the great villains who created evil characters. Such as: Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan (006), Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp: A Georgian lust murderer, Gottfried John as General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko: A computer programmer.It was filmed in beautiful locations in Puerto Rico, Russia, England, UK and in the France.The movie has a lot of insane hard-core action (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), The stunts are completely insane in scale (bungee jumping in - Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility a stunt man performed that stunt in the opening scene.) Bond with a motorcycle jumps on a plane and catches it. Bond drives a tank in Russia for the first time and he demolishes even police cars that was excellent scene. Bond a stuntman jumps out of the window in Russia. Alec Trevelyan\'s train depot - exploding train. The epic climatic fight on the end of the movie between Bond and Trevelyan in his secret Goldeneye satellite control dish in Cuba in which Bond drops Trevelyan out of dish beautiful and really crazy stunt performance.I love the soundtracks in this movie: Goldeneye by Tina Turner and The Experience of Love by Éric Serra. I just love everything about this movie from the actions, to the heroes, to the villains from acting everything abut this movie I just love so much.GoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it.', ""World security is in danger , ¨Janus¨ , a terrorist organization has robbed the ¨Goldeneye¨ , an ultra secret weapon system -a spy satellite- and menaced to use it for destroying a city if doesn't pay and to cause a sabotage on the global financial markets . MI6 -Judi Dench as M- assigns to James Bond the mission to retrieve it . Of course , there's the usual breathtaking opening scene developed in a chemist arms factory located in Siberia . There Bond and agent 006 Alec Trevelyan -Sean Bean- will have to confront against Russian military , but Alec is imprisoned by General Ourumov -Gottfried John- and at the end takes place a deadly confrontation . The film has sensational and spectacularly difficult action set pieces , as the tank pursuit in the city of Saint Petesburg or the taking on the armored train . Action is well shot , , including a groundbreaking and impressive final confrontation developed in Janus headquarter , located in Island Cuba jungle . As always , it appears Q as gadget man who teaches Bond various tools as a bomb pencil that will have special importance posteriorly , besides a speed car -BMW- equipped with rockets launchers . As Bond girls are Famke Janssen as Xena in a sensationalistic and crazed interpretation as the orgasmic to whom all risk is a emotion . Thus , she steals a super-helicopter ¨Tiger¨ and facing off opponents .Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Simanova , a computer specialist , she is marvelous and enticing with a similar countenance to Ingrid Bergman . Plus , it appears unbilled Minnie Driver . Tina Turner sings stunningly the main title and atmospheric score by Eric Serra . The film was finely directed by Martin Campbell . Rating : good and entertaining ."", 'GOLDENEYE, the long-delayed debut of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, was a film mired in MGM\'s convoluted legal problems for six years, problems which had nothing to do with the 007 franchise, but which happened to fall at the worst possible time; after Timothy Dalton\'s \'Serious Bond\' experiment, LICENCE TO KILL, failed to break even in U.S. markets. Despite international grosses that made the film a profitable venture, many American critics, long grumbling that the Bond series had outlasted it\'s welcome, heaped abuse on the newer, leaner direction for \'Bond\', and it\'s taciturn, less light-hearted star...and, with MGM\'s decision to put the expensive series \'on hold\' until their own legal and financial issues could be resolved, LICENCE TO KILL became the unfair \'scapegoat\' for the delay.Much happened during the six-year hiatus; with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist undercurrent of many Bond films (and the subject of most of Ian Fleming\'s novels) was lost; Richard Maibaum, the series\' most prolific screenwriter, passed away, and ill health forced legendary producer Albert (\'Cubby\') Broccoli to turn over his duties to his daughter Barbara, and stepson, Michael G. Wilson (thus ending the other \'prime\' 007 screenwriter\'s script contributions); many other key production figures would retire, die, or move on; and finally, as the delay continued, Timothy Dalton, nearing 50, announced that he was no longer interested in playing James Bond (sparking rumors that Eon Productions, no longer honor-bound by the senior Broccoli\'s choices, had given him \'the boot\').While all this opened the door for Pierce Brosnan\'s long-awaited debut as 007 (after his aborted first attempt, in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS), with a new \'look\' and style for the franchise, whether audiences would even accept a new \'James Bond\' adventure was in doubt. Fortunately, everything \'worked\'. Brosnan, now 42, was more ruggedly believable as 007 than he would have been, at 34, and Dame Judi Dench, as the first woman \'M\' (referring to Bond as a ""sexist, misogynist dinosaur""), proved a perfect successor to the late Bernard Lee. While the plot of the film, involving the master plan of a renegade Russian General (Gottfried John) and an assumed dead 006 (Sean Bean) to use an electronic warfare system (GoldenEye) against England was nothing new, Brosnan\'s daring-do and one-liners (with humor restored to the franchise), as he proved his value in the new world \'order\', found an audience \'primed\' for James Bond\'s return...and the welcome cameo of the series\' last original \'regular\', ""Q"" (Desmond Llewelyn, 81, and as cranky as ever), cemented 007\'s links to both the past and the future.James Bond\'s greatest crisis, whether he still had \'Box Office\', had been overcome, and with audience favorite Pierce Brosnan in place, his emergence into the 21st century was assured.', ""GoldenEye is entertainment, not as classy as some of those before, but among the very best in the series.Perhaps the greatest portrayal of the lead character, with Brosnan and certainly the best opening sequence. There's no way he could make it, heh. The first half much better than the second, they all seem to go on and on though. The Bond girl Scorupco, one of the weakest. However Janssen makes up for it, taking the whole Grace Jones villainess role to another level. Bean an excellent counterpart as well. The secondary characters all decent, could do without Dench though. The song by Tina Turner, outstanding.Alec: For England, James? Bond: No. For me!"", ""One of my favourite quotes from this film you know. As for GoldenEye, I consider it the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films. Pierce Brosnan makes for a great and likable title character, and Judi Dench is rock-solid as always as M. Izabella Scorupco is a splendid Natalya and I loved feisty Xenia, marvellously played by Famke Janssen, who kills her victims by crushing them between her thighs, while Janus is wonderfully mysterious as a villain. Technically, GoldenEye can't be faulted either. The cinematography is beautiful, while the locations are superb and the stunts perfectly done especially the car chase through the streets of St Petersburg. The music and theme song are very memorable too, the pacing is brisk and the script and plot are well intact. GoldenEye mayn't be the best Bond film ever, but it is for me one of the more enjoyable ones. 9/10 Bethany Cox"", 'This film is the best of the classic James Bond films, i.e. those before the Daniel Craig reboot. It hits the right tone where it is not too serious but also not too silly either. The pacing is exciting and Pierce Brosnan is classy as always.', ""The James Bond franchise, in cinematic terms, began in 1962 with Dr No. There followed a Bond movie every couple of years or so (the longest gap between two 007 films was the three-year-hiatus separating The Man With The Golden Gun - 1974 - and The Spy Who Loved Me - 1977). Then, in 1989, with the release of Licence To Kill the series seemed to die. The box office returns of that film were disappointing; the then-Bond actor Timothy Dalton was axed; the film itself was presented in a grittier, more adult style than fans were accustomed to; and various legal wranglings put the Bond character into limbo. Six long years went by without a Bond movie and many insiders predicted an end for the British super-spy and his outrageous screen adventures. Too much time had gone by, they said, no-one was interested any longer in the character or the stories. But then Goldeneye came along, with Pierce Brosnan as Bond - it went on to become a commercial hit, propelling its star into the A-list and reinvigorating the entire series.James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) and his secret agent colleague Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) infiltrate a Russian military installation on a sabotage mission. During the mission, Alec is apparently killed by the enemy forces but Bond manages a miraculous escape. Several years later, a state-of-the-art helicopter is stolen from the West by some Russian spies and used to destroy a Siberian satellite station. When Bond investigates, he discovers to his surprise that the plot involves his old colleague Alec - who is very much alive, having faked his death in the earlier exchange. Trevelyan's plan is to get control of a powerful satellite called the Goldeneye and to use it to destroy a designated target on Earth - in this case, London. It emerges that his parents were Liensk Cossacks, brutally killed by the British when he was a boy, and he has long plotted a way to have his revenge. Bond teams up with a Russian computer programmer, Natalya Semyonova (Isabella Scorupco) and pursues Trevelyan around the globe in an effort to stop his sinister scheme. The trail leads to Cuba, where Trevelyan has a secret lair from which he is on the very brink of unleashing chaos upon the world.... unless 007 can find a way to thwart him.Goldeneye begins with a truly outrageous stunt involving Bond freefalling in pursuit of an unpiloted, plummeting airplane. This dumb but enjoyable scene sets the tone for the rest of the film - very much a tongue-in-cheek, improbable, action-orientated romp. Brosnan is OK as Bond, though I still feel Sean Connery and Roger Moore were slightly better suited to the role. Tina Turner's powerful theme song is very good, but the incidental scoring by Eric Serra has a tinny, tacky feel to it that makes one long for John Barry! As the bad guy, Sean Bean is effective enough even if he never quite matches the memorableness of the all-time great Bond villains (eg Dr No, Oddjob, Blofeld, Francisco Scaramanga). The Bond girls are very good in this one - Scorupco plays a pleasingly resourceful character, while Famke Janssen has great fun as a female baddie who crushes victims between her thighs. Goldeneye is by no means the best of the Bond series, but one has to be thankful to it for getting the dormant series up and running once more. And, in its pacy, breakneck way, it is undeniably a lot of fun."", 'Pierce Brosnan was the best looking and least likable of the six actors to play 007 for the Eon production team. No film demonstrates this better than this, his first.It\'s a new decade for James Bond. Now he works for a woman, has to be evaluated for mental fitness, and with the fall of the Soviet Union must rely on the friendship of old enemies not to mention the enmity of old friends. All this comes into play when he is sent to discover the reason for an explosion at a Russian satellite monitoring station.When ""GoldenEye"" came out, more than six years had passed since the last Bond movie. Many wondered if time had passed James by. The movie plays this up when Bond is called a ""sexist, misogynistic dinosaur"" by his new M (Judi Dench). Bond seems unfazed by this, and everything else.""Trick is to quit while you\'re still ahead,"" says his most charming adversary in this adventure, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen).""That\'s one trick I\'ve never learned,"" Bond replies.Brosnan looks fantastic in the action sequences, better than any Bond before him, and his James Coburn-like grin rivals Connery\'s smirk and Moore\'s raised eyebrow for a facial signature. Too bad his overall smugness gets in the way. Here\'s one Bond you actually root against, especially when pitted against Onatopp. Employing missionary zeal if not position in her quest for the perfect kill, Onatopp is one of Bond\'s most memorable adversaries, and a riot as played by the brave Janssen.Also helping matters a lot is the film\'s other Bond girl, Izabella Scorupco, and a nifty title song from Tina Turner written by Bono and The Edge that captures the spirit if not the sound of 1960s Bond movies. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) gets off some good lines.What loses me about this movie most is the second half, where a once-taut and plausible story (well, except for Bond jumping off a cliff and into an airplane) gives way to a lot of nonsense where Bond drives a tank through St. Petersburg and outraces a speeding train. Crazy visuals are one thing, but Bond kills more Russians in this movie than he did in the whole series up to this point, and many of them are innocent patriots who merely get in his way. So much for the end of the Cold War!Director Martin Campbell, who would go on to unretire Bond more effectively a second time in the later ""Casino Royale"", fashions a clean visual look that gives the action sequences added oomph. There\'s some wheat among the chaff in terms of dialogue, though the writers overdo the humor probably trying to compensate for the previous Bond, Timothy Dalton, whose sober mien was (unfairly) criticized by many. Let\'s just say that our first image of Brosnan as Bond shouldn\'t be of him hanging upside down in a toilet stall, but it is.The Brosnan of ""GoldenEye"" presents us with a good actor and an electric screen presence, but he lacks the occasional deferential quality other Bond actors had; the ability to look at his situation with an encouraging shrug or wink that allowed you to feel some kind of bond with him. Brosnan\'s about coolness and distance, which detract somewhat from the generally decent ""GoldenEye"", and would become more of a problem in time.']"
10,11,112346,9087.0,"[""Aaron Sorkin sets a snappy pace for this classic romance/comedy/Cinderella Story, utilizing the White House, the President, and his staff as the conduit for his dialogue writing prowess.Clearly, this film helped influence the creation of The West Wing four years later, even using the same Oval Office set shown in this film. The sets and atmosphere are presented in immaculate detail, and authentic looking, surpassing anything ever portrayed in film other than the Whitehouse itself. I've been in the real Whitehouse, including the Oval Office, and have also sat at the faux Resolute desk on the set of West Wing (same desk used in this film). There was a tremendous investment made to recreate the real thing in this film, and Reiner pulled it off perfectly.In Sorkin's screenplays, self-confidence, keen intellect, superior communication ability, and one's ethics-compass are at the core of the protagonist's persona.Michael Douglas portrays Democratic President Andrew Shepherd with the same believability and deft touch as he did playing Gordon Gecko in Wall Street.Annette Benning is the ideal girlfriend of the widowed Shepherd, and engages the audience (and Douglas) in one of her most charming performances.A first-class supporting actor ensemble are up to the task of portraying Sorkin's crack White House staff, adding immensely to making this film a feel-good romance that is believable and fun.The plot doesn't delve deeply into the emotions or feelings of Shepard nor Benning's lobbyist charecter Sydney Ellen Wade, but highlights the witty repertoire one would expect from a US President and Capitol Hill lobbyist. The deft skill and movie-star quality each actor has developed in their respective acting careers are showcased with Sorkin's writing in telling this Whitehouse Cinderella story.If the film went deep into emotions, it would have just gotten in the way of a story of a widowed relatively young President falling in love at first sight with Sydney, and the fun of seeing her being thrust into the White House staff and press fish bowl.There is a definite Frank Capra influence to the film.It all works better than it might seem on paper, and we get to enjoy another Rob Reiner classic: A director whose movie-making style and subject-matter is as diverse as anyone in the business."", 'One of the greatest movie finale speeches ever, literal chills. The american president has always been a favorite of mine. The characters are well acted and quite lovely. The storyline is unique and has a good mix of heartfelt and comical. Endlessly rewatchable.', 'The American President (1995)What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don\'t usually go together).What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn\'t a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It\'s funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It\'s acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth.It\'s almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via ""West Wing"") he later becomes the president.But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, ""Love Actually,"" with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind.In fact, I\'m going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn\'t really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it\'s easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He\'s confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah.And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness.Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it\'s not only about politics. In fact it\'s a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out.Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as ""Meathead"") in ""All in the Family."" It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don\'t stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one.But here we have ""The American President,"" deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours.I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.', ""Is there a genre that Rob Reiner can't work in and make successful?  He captured comedy beautifully with The Sure Thing.  Music was brilliant with This is Spinal Tap.  Horror?  How about Misery?  Courtroom drama was awesome with A Few Good Men.  And now we have a political drama/comedy.  There is nothing this man can't do.This movie works inspite of people's claims that it is too political.  Well you know what, it's about the president of the United States of America, there's going to be a bit of poiltics in it.  And guess what, guns do kill people, so to have an issue at hand here that deals with gun control is applaudable.Okay, that's out of the way, let's talk about the film itself.  Because it is wonderful.  It is funny, well acted, and it is written with a good ear.The cast in this film is one to be envied by almost everyone except Oliver Stone and Robert Altman who seem to get everyone to do their films.  But here we have Douglas as the president, Sheen as his aid, Michael J. Fox, Samantha Mathis, Annette Bening as Sydney Ellen Wade and in my favourite performance, Richard Dreyfuss as the sniveling weasle Senator Bob Rumsen.As the story goes, the president's character gets questioned when he ( a widow ) finds a girlfriend in Sydney Wade.  The issues are handled wonderfully here.  Nothing is really tip-toed around as the script writer ( Aaron Sorkin ) writes a brave script about what is right and wrong with being the president and having a girlfriend.I personally liked the politics in the film.  I enjoyed how Shepherd decides to ignore the critisism leveled at him until the very end when he gives one of the best written speeches I've ever seen in film.  And when he flexes his authoritative muscles, you feel his power, you feel that the president has spoken.  And I was moved.  This is a great film and one that should be checked out for sure.****  I also found it to be interesting that the character in the film that tries to get the issue of gun control brought to the forefront is Michael J. Fox.  He is Canadian and we don't have problems with guns here.  Is it a coincidence ( probably ) that he was chosen to play this role?  Or was it done deliberately?  Interesting."", 'US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy.  Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist.  Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency.This is not exactely a political thriller.  In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine.  However that\'s the point, this film doesn\'t pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen\'s President in TV\'s The West Wing.  However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing.  Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well.Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or ""oil baron"" Bush who would you pick?  Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do.  The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances.Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it\'s done with so much class that it\'s hard not to like it.  Not brillant, but very enjoyable all the same.', ""This is a great feel good movie about a charismatic, essentially very decent, fictional U.S. President, played by Michael Douglas in an extremely likable role. It's a political story as well as a love story. Douglas is both commanding & assured in his presidential role and charming & endearing in his romantic role. If anyone has not yet seen this movie, you'll discover you're in for an unexpected treat. There's something here for everyone...romance, comedy, politics, and drama. Andrew Shepherd is a youngish, popular President soon up for re election. Pressure is being put to bear on him to consolidate his administration's high poll ratings by pushing through a moderate crime bill which totally lacks Republican party support, yet is considered too weak by the Democrats. Meanwhile he finds himself attracted to Sydney Wade, an environmental lobbyist who is seeking legislation to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. Shepherd has been widowed for three years, and currently needs an escort for a State Dinner in honour of the President of France. He invites Sydney to this function and during this & subsequent encounters, the pair fall in love. Trouble ensues when Shepherd is torn between the politically expedient crime bill and the environmental legislation he has promised his new love interest. In terms of romance, there is the ongoing love story between the widowed President and the young lobbyist, Sydney, charmingly played by Annette Benning. This lovely and intelligent lady is quite smitten but at first obviously a bit overwhelmed by it all, feeling awkward and uncertain as the President's date. Sydney looks absolutely radiant at the state ball as she is swept off her feet by this handsome leader of the free world. Their chemistry proves to be electric, the dialogue clever, and the potential sexual situations quite tasteful by modern standards. Naturally the course of true love never does run smooth so it goes without saying that additionally, this unusual fishbowl courtship would have some unique problems as politics and public opinion intrude upon the couple's personal life.A certain built in comedy natural for a dating President makes this romance all the more enchanting. For instance, when Andrew attempts to buy his sweetheart some roses, can't you just imagine the national crisis that all but ensues? Despite his position as Head of State, Andrew likes to do his courting the old fashioned, personal way. During his initial phone call to Sydney, she believes he's one of her friends pulling a prank, which of course results in some hilarity.Naturally this tale is ripe with politics, and some reviewers even claim that the film is something of a precursor to TV's West Wing. Shepherd faces the dilemma of being forced to choose between the crime bill that his party is after him to push, versus Sydney's particular environmental cause. Not only party politics, but there is waning public support to consider. Needless to say, the President has no lack of advisers around who are more than eager to state their views, giving at times unsolicited advice. Martin Sheen plays his Chief of Staff and Michael J. Fox is cast as his Domestic Policy adviser. Shepherd must also contend with mud slinging by a nasty, unscrupulous rival Senator (portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss), who calls into question both Shepherd's family values and his girlfriend's activist past. By the way, any liberal political bias presented in this movie proved totally inoffensive to me. I definitely didn't sense that the producers had a nefarious grand agenda here.Drama wise, there's a touching, close relationship depicted between the President and his charming young teenage daughter, Lucy, and a definite sense of his loneliness following the death of his wife from cancer. Also, Shepherd is confronted with the choice of keeping his promise to Sydney versus salvaging his political career. His Oval Office moral dilemmas are not only relevant to the Presidency but can be extrapolated to any person in any career.This film delivers a powerful message about both personal and presidential integrity. At one point there's a moving speech that is inspiring for anyone, but may give American viewers in particular cause for reflection about the real significance of their country's Presidency and the qualities they might want to look for in the person elected to that office. Personally, I was practically ready to start flying the Stars and Stripes and I'm not even American! Whatever the nation involved, pity we don't have more Andrew Shepherds in political life today."", ""The writing is sharp, though you can tell Sorkin hadn't quite mastered his style. The story is actually pretty reasonable and makes for an interesting film. Michael Douglas is excellent as the president and you can see the model from which Sorkin would craft Josiah Bartlet. All in all, this is a decent diversion and I enjoyed most of it."", 'Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of \'normal\' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely ""clued in"", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.', 'I don\'t mean that as a slam. I like Pretty Woman a lot, too. But this movie is my ""cure for all ills"" movie. The one I throw in the DVD player on rainy Sunday afternoons and crack out my best junk food. And the political setting seems to give it more meat.Michael Douglas is perfect. Annette Benning is perfect (and I would give anything to look as beautiful as she does in that blue dress at the State Dinner). Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen, Anna Devoure Smith. People being passionate about each other and about important issues and about doing the right thing. Everything about this movie lifts me up when I\'m feeling down.\nI\'m not a liberal, and I\'m not a conservative - I fall somewhere in the middle. My beliefs in gun control to not include ""(getting) the guns"". But this movie is so good - that I can look past the occasional differences in political views. Those views are presented in a smart, thoughtful and constructive manner - and I appreciate them even though they are not my own.\nI enjoy this movie for what it is - a sweet, smart, funny movie set in one of the most ""romantic"" settings in the world - The White House.']"
11,12,112896,12110.0,"[""Mel Brooks, one of my favorite directors of all time, he's delivered some of the most memorable comedies: Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs, The Producers, High Anxiety, Blazing Saddles, Robin Hood: Men in Tights. He now brings us Dracula: Dead and Loving it, one of my favorite guilty pleasures. I know there is a bit of hate for this movie because a lot of people say that Mel lost his touch and this isn't as funny as his older films. Let's face it, Mel peeked pretty early in his career with Young Frankenstein, which is one of my favorite films of all time, but everyone is naturally going to compare every film that he made at that point with his greatest movies. But if you seriously are telling me that there was not one scene that you didn't laugh at then you need your funny bone checked.The year is 1893, solicitor Thomas Renfield travels all the way from London to Transylvania to meet an important client. As he nears the end of his journey, the sun sets, and the stagecoach driver refuses to take him any further. Kindly villagers plead with him to turn back, but Renfield explains that he is expected. Renfield arrives safely and meets Count Dracula, a charming but rather strange man who is, of course, a vampire. Dracula signs the papers finalizing the purchase of Carfax Abbey in England, and Renfield retires for the night. He wakes up when two Brides of Dracula come gliding seductively in. Dracula then casts a hypnotic spell on the suggestible Renfield, making him his slave. Dracula and Renfield soon embark for England. He goes ashore, leaving Renfield behind. When Renfield is discovered alone on the ship, he is confined to a lunatic asylum. Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next.Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper! 8/10"", 'This Dracula spoof has many original laughs along the way. After all the recent Vampire movies it\'s even more funny.Typical Mel Brooks humor is laugh out loud and crude. The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula\'s helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce ""Lucy"".It\'s not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it\'s got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn\'t a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.', 'This was another entertaining Mel Brooks farce, a la Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. If you liked those, you\'d like this.Peter MacNichol almost steals the show in this film as ""Renfield."" He just drives me buggy. Leslie Nielsen, who revived his career later in life playing goofy roles, also is very good, this time as \'Dracula."" Actually, I thought he was far better in here than in those other spoofs, such as the ""Naked Gun"" series. It may be his best comedic role.The two women in here, Amy Yasback and Lysette Anthony, are beautiful, and well-endowed as Brooks - and a lot of us guys - likes \'em. They are in the film for their looks while the other two provide the laughs.Story-wise, it\'s just a light-hearted look at the story of Dracula, told many times in the films, mostly in the serious vein (pun intended) except for ""Love At First Bite"" which was similar in laughs to this. After watching this film, I could never look at garlic or blood the same way!When you need some good laughs and nothing else, this will fill the need for an hour-and-a-half.', 'I remember being an 11 year old boy in stitches with laughter when I first viewed this film on new release VCR (yeah, video - old school)!Having just watched this film again recently I have to say that it\'s still just as funny as it was as a child. The film of course is a parody on the \'Dracula"" mythos and the jokes and gags are much better understood if you\'ve watched films such as ""Bram Stoker\'s: Dracula"" which I can\'t watch seriously anymore cos\' I constantly think of this film in certain scenes and start laughing! The cast is brilliant in their roles especially Leslie Neilsen as ""Dracula"" and his brain-washed slave ""Renfield"" (Peter MacNicol) portraying an insane, insect eating madman extraordinarily well!The humour is all in the typical Mel Brooks \'tongue-in-cheek\' style and also quite reminiscent of Monty Python in parts, the over-the-top British accents may attribute to that part.The final film directed by Mel Brooks, ""Dracula Dead and Loving It"" is very entertaining and the mindless humour make for a very enjoyable spoof movie!Highly recommended : )', 'While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Young Frankenstein"", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it\'s a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn\'t in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that\'s full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the ""Children of the Night"" and ""the mess they make"" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He\'s a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they\'re worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of ""curtain call"" at the end that we don\'t see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.', ""Renfield set out to find Count Dracula in Transylvania, and it was immediately clear from people's reactions that this would be a funny movie. Eventually, Renfield and Dracula ended up on a ship, and in England, Dracula began causing problems for Dr. Seward, the man running an asylum, and his daughters. Renfield was apparently Dracula's servant by this time. Dr. Van Helsing was called in to find out what was going on.I like this kind of comedy. It wasn't 'Naked Gun' or 'Airplane!' but Leslie Nielsen, Harvey Korman and Mel Brooks were very good given the material. I didn't care for the blood and gore, but sometimes the gore was not violent, just silly. Some highlights:When one hypnotizes someone, that person must be sure that when he says to forget everything you've been told by the hypnotist, that this applies only after you have done what the hypnotist said to do. Dracula did not.Dracula hypnotized Mina and Essie at the same time.One person who turned into a vampire had to be killed for good with a stake.I'm not saying whether this was accomplished, only that the attempt was hilarious.'Oh, yes, we have Nosferatu.'Dracula danced in front of a mirror. Great special effects, good choreography since the partner had to know what to do alone."", '""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" is a movie that seems to define what someone either really likes or dislikes about a comedy, and more specifically a parody: gags.  For me, the gags herein worked, there were reasons for their having been used and therefore makes it funny to me.  The storyline didn\'t stall, the gags weren\'t desperate for laughs, and the acting was exactly what was needed: the comedic touch.  The casting choice to have Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck, both veterans of the TV series ""Wings"", was brilliant because the chemistry between their personalities was proven and honed before the movie.  The choice of Leslie Nielsen for the titular role was dead-on.  Someone that has the wisdom of centuries (decades, whatever), is cunning (a la the Naked Gun series), and above all, never gives up (until turned to dust).  Mel Brooks, having proved his comedic prowess with films like ""Young Frankenstein"", comes through in the role of Van Helsing.  Even the incidental characters seem to have a reason to belong and flow in the movie, like Essie, the guardian of Mina, or Martin, Dr. Seward\'s right-hand man of the sanitarium...Martin:  ""...the patient in the west wing?  He\'s havin\' a conniption fit.""Dr. Seward:  ""Oh.  Give him an enima.""As stated, the movie will most likely be quite funny or very dull, depending on what the viewer expects from it beforehand.  Being that I like a good slapstick comedy (and I do), the performances above all are what were able to pull me in.FOOSH-TAA!""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" gets 9 of 10 stars', ""Mel Brooks's scattergun approach to comedy has a number of misses. Spaceballs was OK at parodying its genre. This film is far more sophisticated and well played.The successful jokes are on the culture of Victorain times with references to an engaged couple who after 10 years have suddenly held hands being condemned as immoral, prostitutes, lechers and the like. Into these cultural and successful observations Brook's introduces Leslie Nielson doing a great impression of Bela Lugosi's Dracula with the difference that his powers are incompetent.Seeing the Lugosi movie will give you the basis to appreciate the sophistication of this film."", 'This comedy followed the Bram Stoker book very closely. It merely turned the whole tale into a hilarious romp, making fun of Dracula and his inept sidekick, Renfield, as well as the other characters. A lot of slapstick gags in this film, some I saw coming from a mile off, but I still got a kick out of them. I especially liked the scene where Van Helsing and Harker staked the vampire in the tomb - what a riot. Neilson was great as the troubled bloodsucker.']"

I first saw this movie when I was seven. And to this day, I still love it. Kevin Bacon supplies the voice of Balto, a half-bred wolf who risks his life to travel in the cold of Alaska to retrieve a sled of dogs that were lost while bringing antibiodics back to the town of Nome to stop an epidemic. BALTO is a film to see on a cold, Sunday when you have nothing better to do. You will enjoy this film greatly. After viewing it once, you will want to see it again. I lost track of how many times I have seen this film. But it has been more than thirty times. See this movie. It's well worth seeing. This one is one that I am proud to have in my video collection.....5/5."", ""This film has a seriousness and drama to it that will surprise you. There are no songs, and it has an adult feel to it, with mature themes and exciting action. The voice characters are its main failing, with Kevin Bacon giving rather flat performance to Balto, and there is an overall lack of conviction in most of the other voices as well.  But this movie has good story and excellent pacing- there are several gripping action sequences, and very few childish moments. Balto is an excellent family film, and will keep adults and older kids enthralled and entertained.  I think it's a little too serious for very young kids to enjoy, though.  It has realism and is not light hearted. There are ideas about sickness, death and prejudice which are used very well to move this story along and help resolve it in the end. This is a hero story with a feel-good ending, and plenty of adventure along the way.  The art and appearance is interesting and unique, mostly classic animation with a few computer assisted scenes-- the overall look is tidy and quality, with some charm and humor that will get you smiling.  It has a live action entry and closure (including a view of the Balto statue in Central Park) which acts as a tie-together, and the true story behind this movie gives it additional appeal. This film, like the WB's 'Iron Giant', has been breezed over by the public and not gotten the recognition it deserves. I would recommend Balto for anyone who likes dogs, realism, or just a smooth, enjoyable film."", 'It\'s not hard to see why this movie wasn\'t particularly popular (check out the scene where the carpenter is shown sadly preparing small coffins), but that doesn\'t mean it isn\'t worth a look.  It\'s actually one of the best underrated animated films of the 90\'s.  The drama is real, the visuals are beautiful, and the story ends happily.  The live action prologue and epilogue are a little distracting, but they\'re made up for by a random (and hilarious) visual shout-out to ""E.T.""', ""I can completely understand why people love this movie, because while for me it isn't the greatest animated movie ever(Beauty and the Beast gets that honour I'm afraid), it is a pretty darn good movie. It is certainly quite powerful and ambitious, and there are parts that tug at the heartstrings. The film isn't laden with humour as much as something like The Lion King or Castle of Cagliostro, but with the characters Boris, Muk and Luk it is evident.The animation is surprisingly detailed. Critics complained of the animation quality being dull and tacky, and when I saw that I thought did we see the same movie. The colours were fine, maybe not the most vibrant colouring in the world like FernGully for instance, but the character animation and the backgrounds are immaculate. The music by James Horner, one of my favourite film composers, is outstanding. Maybe not his finest, as he has done some amazing scores, the one he did for Land Before Time really packs an emotional punch even on repeated viewing, but it is very powerful, poignant and haunting all at the same time and even enhances the drama.Then there are the characters. Balto is a lovable and handsome dog, and Jenna is so beautiful and headstrong. In contrast, we have Boris who is hilarious and Steele a villain detestable in quite a substantial way. The voice acting is very good, Kevin Bacon while an unlikely choice initially does an above decent job, not monotonic or bland like some other celebrities who have voiced in animated films. Bob Hoskins gives great comic relief as Boris, and Phil Collins is amusing as Muk and Luk. Bridget Fonda does well as Jenna, but I have to say Jim Cummings is absolutely BRILLIANT as Steele; Cummings is a very underrated veteran voice actor, and his malevolent voice over proves what talent as a voice actor he has.The film does have an engaging, sometimes tense sometimes heartwarming story, and while perhaps in need of a little more humour, the script wasn't actually that bad. All in all, very overlooked as an animated film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"", ""Where can I start? This movie is greatly animated, directed and written.

Whether you're a kid or an adult, you will find yourself cheering Balto on."", 'Balto & his friends, Boris, Muk, Luk & Jenna are characters to capture the heart.

The music was probably the best part of all, with the excellent orchestral background, full of dramatic phrases during an intense part of the movie. It especially sounds great when you're supporting surround sound.This movie was a great movie and people think it was one of the greatest letdowns in the 1990's.

13,14,113987,10858.0,"['In an overall solid cast, Anthony Hopkins shines in a powerful performance as Richard Nixon in this Oliver Stone film tracing the former president\'s life from his boyhood in California to his resignation as U.S. President in 1974.Nixon is seen as a troubled figure, insecure and paranoid, with few friends. An unhappy childhood, in which he refers to himself as his mother\'s ""faithful dog,"" in fact does dog him his whole life, as he seeks to please a demanding ultra-religious mother (Mary Steenburgen)who had already died by the time he took office as President, but whose memory and expectations lived on. Nixon is burdened with an unhappy marriage to Pat (Joan Allen) - unhappy largely because of his own obsession with political success - and haunted by the ghost of John Kennedy, who defeated him for the presidency in 1960 and who Nixon could never live up to. Kennedy was loved; Nixon was hated - he could never get over that. A scene near the end of the movie demonstrates his feelings toward JFK as he looks at Kennedy\'s White House portrait: ""They look at you and see what they want to be; they look at me and see who they are.""Although the movie - as any review of Nixon\'s life will - revolves around Watergate, it provides a fascinating summary of his life, and of what added up to make him the troubled and lonely figure he really was. There\'s also typical Oliver Stone material as dark hints of conspiracy extending far beyond Watergate are inserted. Perhaps the most unsettling being a meeting Nixon has shortly before JFK\'s assassination with some supporters in Texas who are trying to convince him to run for the presidency again in 1964. Nixon protests that Kennedy can\'t be beaten in \'64. A Cuban American present says ominously ""What if Kennedy doesn\'t run in \'64?""A truly fascinating portrayal of a fascinating man, even in the end somewhat sympathetic to Nixon as the film ends with his 1994 funeral service, some comments at that service by President Clinton and a summary of his career by a narrator pointing out his accomplishments. A last note: kudos to Paul Sorvino, who hit Henry Kissinger bang on.8/10', 'Watergate hardly gets a mention in this film.  We see the \'plumbers\' donning rubber gloves, and the president fumbling with a few of his tapes, but detail is almost totally eschewed.  There is no Egil Krogh, no Jeb Magruder.  Kleindienst and Gray are mentioned only in passing.  Cox is fired by way of a spoken TV bulletin, Jaworski is not referred to at all.  We do not see anything of the titanic courtroom struggles, with all three branches of the federal government locking horns.  Though we are told that the American Constitution is self-righting, like a boat immune from capsize, we are not shown how or why.     And in this, Oliver Stone is perfectly right.  As it stands, the film is very long, and dense with detail.  There is no room for the minutiae of the cover-up, which in any event would make for a confusing narrative. Stone\'s subject is Nixon the man, not the edifice that toppled around him.     And what a man.  Richard Milhous Nixon is a truly fascinating personality - both statesman and charlatan: ruthless and vulnerable: unable to express his emotions, yet the most emotional of politicians: a man who spent his life in the law and in high office, but who never absorbed the legal and ethical mores of public life.  Genius and crook, bold visionary and spiteful backstabber, Nixon will continue to spellbind biographers for decades to come.     ""That\'s when it starts,"" says Stone\'s Nixon, ""when you\'re a kid.""  The film takes us to Whittier, California in 1925 to see the unloved boy who struggled painfully to earn his parents\' approval, without ever quite succeeding.  As a teenager, he levered his way into the school football squad by sheer willpower.  Lacking talent, he doggedly subjected himself to repeated physical battering in the scrimmages, ""a tackle dummy with guts"". This syndrome recurs throughout his career.  Always susceptible to scathing criticism, never quite commanding respect, Nixon never the less kept ploughing back into the melee when wiser, lesser men would have quit.  It is hardly surprising that the years of punishment should have left psychological scars.     Nixon\'s hatred of John Kennedy had more than one source.  He was devastated by the defeat in the 1960 presidential election, but not simply because of disappointment at losing, or even because the Kennedy victory carried the odour of fraud: bitterest of all for Nixon was the realisation that the Kennedy people had played hardball more effectively than the Republicans.  Nixon had been out-sharked, and it hurt.  On a more profound level still, John Kennedy was everything that Nixon could never be.  He was a smooth, handsome prince among men, exuding poise and confidence, a patrician imbued with the habit of authority.  To Nixon, the perpetual outsider, the quaker geek who looked shoddy and disreputable, Kennedy seemed to have the dice unfairly loaded in his favour.  JFK was an East Coast bright boy and war hero, fabulously wealthy and impeccably well-connected. Nixon owned nothing and knew nobody, and was all too obviously \'on the make\'.  The great witch-hunts, of Hiss in the 1940\'s and Ellsberg in the 1970\'s, are manifestations of the chip on Nixon\'s shoulder, the fathomless bile that he directed at East Coast college boys.     Nixon always imagined that he was hiding his pain from the world, whereas in fact it was on global display.  His nervous little laugh at moments of emotional crisis was so false, so gut-wrenchingly inappropriate, that the onlooker could catch a glimpse of the man\'s tortured soul.  Hopkins captures the wretched laugh with devastating effectiveness, both in the scene where Nixon is confronted by a hostile man in the TV studio audience, and when he solemnly promises that none of the president\'s men will go to jail.  In the ""Checkers"" broadcast and the presidential TV address on Watergate, Nixon tries to assure the camera that he is not a crook, and on both occasions he has the exact opposite effect, confirming to the viewer that that is precisely what he is.  Nixon seems incapable of examining his own conscience: there is a hard core which his rational mind cannot penetrate.  Maybe that is why Stone has him referring to himself in the third person throughout the film.     \'They\' were always out to get Nixon, without it ever being made clear just exactly who \'they\' might be.  The imperative for this deeply paranoid man was always to be braced, ready for the coming tackle, or to organise pre-emptive strikes against \'them\'.  Obstructing justice and tampering with evidence were, to Nixon, self-defensive steps that did not need to be justified.  It was obvious that such things had to be done.  The mystery at the heart of Watergate - why a president so steeped in criminal conspiracy should tape-record his own intimate conversations - makes sense when viewed from Nixon\'s end of the telescope.  He had to have the goods on his own men, ready for the day when they turned on him.  It goes even further.  This emotional cripple could not bare his bleeding soul to anyone, so his tapes became his confessional and his confidante.  Stone\'s film repeatedly shows Nixon in his awkward arms-extended, double V-sign pose.  It is not by chance that it looks like a crucifixion.', 'Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by ""JFK"", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his ""Nixon"" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It\'s also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it\'s definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot.""Nixon"" borrows a lot of elements from ""JFK"" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to ""Citizen Kane"", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood.The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious \'Rosebud\'. Behind every great man, there\'s a secret, but in Nixon\'s case, there\'s also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband\'s shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him.The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon\'s journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon\'s dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with ""JFK"" stops, it\'s not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background ""in the poorest farm of California"", always using it as an alibi to justify that he\'s one of the \'little people\'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can\'t renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: ""Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain."" This taste for revenge is his inner demon.I\'m not comparing two characters, but ""Nixon"" kind of reminded me of ""Downfall"" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state\'s ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz\' performance as Hitler: ""Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed."" In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren\'t nobler. And that\'s what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the \'person we love to hate\'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy\'s shining smile, from his ""I\'m not a crook"" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to ""The Simpsons"" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he\'s in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it\'s a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy\'s picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon\'s tragedy is America\'s, and maybe that\'s why he was loathed, because people don\'t want to look at themselves.', 'I\'m not normally a fan of Oliver Stone (in fact, I\'ve NEVER liked an Oliver Stone picture before)but this one just blew me away. The reason I usually don\'t like him is that, though he is a great technical director and visual stylist, his scripts are heavy-handed and one-sided to the point of absurdity. But not here. In fact, the script is perhaps the most impressive element in this whole movie, not only for how ambiguous and even-handed it is in dealing with Nixon as a character, but also for the brilliant way it moves around in time. It starts with Nixon, feeling embattled in the White House in 1973 as the Watergate hearings are upon him, and uses the device of him listening to his secret tapes to jump back and forth to previous eras, flawlessly moving between past and present to give an impressionistic, kaleidoscopic overview of the man\'s life, instead of following the staid and ho-hum linear approach most movie biographies take (most recent example: ""Man on the Moon"", the bio on Andy Kaufman which was a snoozer in spite of a great performance by Jim Carrey mainly because of the dry boring, ""This happened. . .And then this happened"" approach).Another reason to see this film is the brilliant, absolutely overwhelming lead performance by Anthony Hopkins; his Nixon may not look or sound exactly like the 37th president (but come on, except maybe for Ed Sullivan, who does?) but he embodies his qualities - strengths as well as weaknesses - to such an enormous degree that he simply BECOMES Nixon, at least for the three hours the movie is on screen.I have to say, though, I was not nearly as impressed as every one else (critics and general audiences alike) seems to be about Joan Allen as Pat Nixon. It\'s nothing against her performance, she did fine, it\'s just that as written, the part is rather weak. In fact, I was much more bothered about the liberties the filmmakers took in fleshing out her character than in all the political events; it\'s like, whenever they wanted to have someone blast Nixon or act as his conscience, they\'d trot out Ol\' Pat, giving her some of the most embarrasingly ""speechified"" moments in all of the movies - almost none of their scenes together ringed true as husband as wife; it was more like Nixon sitting across from the Filmmakers\' Conscience. In fact, she\'s angry at him so often in the film you have to wonder, what exactly does she love about the man? The film never answers (or attempts to answer) this question.But this one minor quibble is not enough to make me downgrade this film. It is an absolutely stunning achievement by any stretch of the imagination, and it contains some interesting thematic and technical echoes of both Citizen Kane (cavernous high ceiling scenes, a ""March of Time""-type newsreel on Nixon, a dinner scene between Dick and Pat at a long, impersonal table) as well as The Godfather (the burnished, half-dark half-light cinematography, several ""chamber of power"" scenes in tight, dark and claustrophobic rooms)that I found, in context, to be totally appropriate. It paints both Nixon and the times he (and the country) lived through on a grand and mythic scale that was truly awesome and, once again, entirely appropriate. Yes, it\'s a film that is at times big, loud and bombastic (because so, after all, was Nixon himself) but, just as often quiet, contemplative and told at an achingly *human* level. The contrast between these two states is what gives the film a good deal of its overall power and, as I\'ve said, I never would have believed that Stone would have been capable of doing the smaller, quieter scenes so well.This is a good film to have on tape or DVD, for two reasons. It\'s so long, and so dense with facts, characters and events, that you\'re not likely to want to watch it all the way straight through (the first time I saw it was in the theater and though I was held spellbound, I began wishing for an intermission at about the two-hour mark, not so much to stretch my legs but to give my brain a chance to process all I\'d seen and heard so far). Also, and more importantly, the videotape includes after the credits two scenes cut out of the final film for time purposes. In both cases, I believe, a severe mistake was made - these are both, I believe, ESSENTIAL sequences; not just nice to have as an additional bargain, but scenes which Stone should have fought tooth and nail to keep in (even cutting out some others if he had to - my vote would have been to excise a few of those Pat Nixon scenes instead). Once scene involves Nixon\'s visit to the CIA and another a discussion between Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover in the Oval Office. The first scene is a masterpiece of writing and acting (with Sam Waterston as CIA Director Richard Helms, otherwise in no other scene of the movie) and the other is, I think, key in understanding Nixon\'s motivation to begin taping his White House conversations in the first place (also - an issue which is touched on no other place in the movie). I feel that these two scenes should be edited back into their appropriate places in the movie; seeing them separated from the rest of the film is better than not seeing them at all, but they really belong as part of the entire story.', 'Richard Nixon\'s (Oscar-nominee Anthony Hopkins) life is told from his early childhood days in 1920s California to his disgraceful resignation in 1974 from the Watergate scandal (one of the stupidest and most trivial events of U.S. history). The 37th president of the U.S. lost the 1960 presidential election to JFK and then lost the California governor race of 1962. By 1963 it appears that Nixon is out of the spotlight for good politically and that he is struggling to keep his marriage to Pat Nixon (a superb turn by Oscar-nominee Joan Allen in arguably her finest role) alive. Things turn strange though as Nixon has strange meetings with big-time oil men in Texas (Larry Hagman leading the group) and even with J. Edgar Hoover (scene-stealer Bob Hoskins). It is obvious that there are some potentially sinister things going on from high-ranking people. Soon JFK is assassinated, the 1964 election becomes a mess for both parties as LBJ wins by default and then LBJ decides not to run in 1968. The Republicans once again turn to Nixon, but Nixon (full of self-doubt and inferiority complexes) is fearful that 1968 against RFK will be a repeat of 1960 (Nixon believes that JFK and the Democrats stole the 1960 presidency). More cloak and dagger situations occur and RFK is assassinated in California, leaving the door open for Nixon to win the presidency. Vietnam, a whole host of questionable allies (led by James Woods, E.G. Marshall, J.T. Walsh, David Paymer, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Fyvush Finkel) and constant advisement from Henry Kissinger (an amazing transformation by Paul Sorvino, who rivals Hopkins\' performance the whole way) end up turning Nixon\'s life upside down. Soon taped White House conversations and growing paranoia also pops up and public/national/international/military/social chaos ensues. While all this occurs the president\'s personal life is shown through flashbacks (Mary Steenburgen as his mother and Tony Goldwyn as his older brother dominate these parts of the film). We see two of his brothers dying of tuberculosis, his short courtship of his wife and various other parts of his early life that stand out. The Watergate break-in (led by Ed Harris) continues to be one of the strangest things that has ever happened (the motives of the apparent burglary have never been clear). 18 minutes of missing audio recordings are one of the biggest mysteries of the 20th Century. Director Oliver Stone (who received an Oscar nod for co-writing the script) surprisingly is unbiased with this film. Watching ""Platoon"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""JFK"" would lead one to believe that Stone would pull no punches with ""Nixon"". However he gives Nixon\'s story an element of truth and compassion. There are so many unknown things that went on with Nixon throughout his political career that Stone has to fill in lots of missing pieces with speculations (some that seem very logical and some not so much). Thus the film goes on and on (running about 195 minutes). Even with all the airtime though the film does not move slowly and never becomes dull. In fact it is one of those projects that could have gone on even longer and it still would have been an interest-generator. Whether you like, dislike or are indifferent when it comes to Nixon the person, ""Nixon"" the movie is an outstanding achievement that stands high with Stone\'s better works and also deceptively becomes one of the more under-rated and under-appreciated pictures of the 1990s. 5 stars out of 5.', ""Oliver Stone has a way of making films that grab you and hold you until the final frame.  His films are usually controversial and that's what generates much debate and Nixon is no exception.  Anthony Hopkins assumes the mantle of Richard M. Nixon and he does it with style. His Nixon is a complex man, full of ambition and dreams, but also filled with demons.  Nixon lives in the shadow of JFK, and because of that, he feels he can never live up to the greatness that he aspires to.  Joan Allen is equally convincing as Pat Nixon.  She is a strong woman who loves her husband, but unlike Nixon, she grows tired of the political world. The film works best when we see the inner workings of the Nixon Whitehouse.  We see the coverup of the Watergate break in.  We see Nixon's historic visit to China and we see the final farewell of a flawed, but ambitious man.  It's hard to cram an entire lifetime into a three hour film, but Stone manages to do it well.  We get brief glimpses into Nixon's past and we see the events that eventually undid him.  Some may say that Nixon is painted in an unfair light.  I think Stone actually sympathizes with him.  Here was a man who came into power in the middle of a war.  He was feared by many and misunderstood by all.   Nixon was able to rise above it all for a short period of time, and in that brief period, he did have the world."", ""I will start by saying I am an Oliver Stone fan. For some particular reason though I did not expect to like this movie but obviously I did. He actually unexpectedly gave a very fair depiction of Nixon. Nixon really transformed before my eyes in here. That was really something special to see.The acting was quite good. Anthony Hopkins though totally uplifted this movie. I could imagine many people saying his performance was over-the-top or a bit too surreal at times. Yet that is what really made his performance so amazing. The way he was able to transform the many crazy and totally off the wall aspects of Nixon and make them into a reality. To me as the movie went on I felt I was in some way able to see his paranoia, anxiety, thirst for power and just the simple fact of wanting to be liked. I could see he was more of a troubled and vulnerable man than a monster. He never quite connected with anybody which made him bitter and fueled his paranoia and greed even more. To me Hopkins portrayed this all perfectly, all the complexities and inner feelings of Nixon. Hopkins slipped into this role in way that you rarely see. He became Nixon, and at times I was speechless or should I say thoughtless watching him portray such an important figure in such a way. More and more I felt sorry for Nixon, as he looked more and more like a schizophrenic. To me this role was more psychologically bone-chilling than his role as Hannibal Lechter in Silence of the Lambs and I have no problem debating that. The rest of the cast was quite good as well. Joan Allen was very good in showing the complex relationship/marriage she had with Richard Nixon. James Woods freaked me out at times displaying that pure evil and hatred at times that Hopkins showed as Nixon. Paul Sorvino was very good as Henry Kissinger. Mary Steenburgen was interesting to watch in the very limited time she played in here. The two actors though other than Hopkins though that really stood out to me were Bob Hoskins and Sam Waterston. Despite Hoskins not giving an amazing performance and having very limited time he gave me chills just seeing J. Edgar Hoover being portrayed in some sort of way. Sam Waterston despite being limited to really just one scene was even more chilling than the rest of the cast(excluding Hopkins) combined in that one moment. That moment was one of the most intense face to face scenes that I have ever seen. It was so memorable.The directing was very good. It was not the best I have seen from Oliver Stone but it was up there. For the first 45 minutes or so I was a bit confused about what was happening and the flow of the movie but I got used to it. The first portion of the movie did feel unbalanced at times but the feel of the movie got better as it wore on. Going back to that one scene between Sam Waterston and Anthony Hopkins, I felt this scene was one of the best directed and written scenes I have seen from Oliver Stone or anyone ever. That scene was a microcosm of the movie. The motion-sickness, mind scrambling, paranoid feeling of that scene captured the entire movie. The feeling of even seeing the president himself being treated like a puppet, despite not that shocking, was mind numbing to watch. That scene was true testament to the writing and directing abilities of Oliver Stone.The writing was also very good throughout. It seemed as if everything Stone wanted to get across got across. The writing was not amazing but it certainly served it duty. The cinematography was great though. Stone always knows how to get his point across in the way he photographs a movie even if all of other aspects of the movie fail. That dark Oliver Stonish feeling kept on creeping in on every scene, but also that dark psychological feeling that he had put in Born On the Fourth of July and Platoon also was felt through the cinematography. The music by John Williams, who always knows how to capture a moment musically, was simply perfect in here again.I can understand this movie being boring to a lot of people or it being considered propaganda. Yet I think this movie is an overlooked masterpiece. Just seeing Anthony Hopkins perform as Nixon is a good enough reason to see this movie. He took control of this movie by force and took it to another level. Despite this being an Oliver Stone movie it is more fair than you would think. Of course this movie may have a few conspiracy theories included in it but Oliver Stone never forces his theories on people. There is a reason why at the beginning at every movie he puts a disclaimer saying that not everything in his movies are facts. Despite it being great I don't know if this is a movie for everyone. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn't that how life seems to be at times as well?"", 'Hopkins is remarkable as Nixon.  Wisely not even trying for an exact likeness, his interpretation of that so-familiar physicality is uncannily evocative.  From the very start, the characterisation is spot-on - the jut of the lower jaw, the growly voice, the rounded shoulders.  Once the viewer has adjusted to the initial shock, Hopkins IS Nixon.  It ceases to be an issue.Theodore Roosevelt, Washington, Kennedy and (most of all) Lincoln look down from the White House walls at Nixon, their solemn portraits hovering like admonishing ghosts over the Watergate squalor.  In life, Roosevelt was bold and self-assured, whereas Nixon dithers: Washington\'s self-effacing propriety confronts a Nixon who is suggesting that the Nazis were right. Kennedy is everything that Nixon could never be - above all else, at ease with himself.  Lincoln looks down, from the office wall and from his marble seat in the Memorial, in silent rebuke as his successor debases the presidency.Some of the camera tricks don\'t work.  We see Nixon rooted to the spot at Love Field as the camera soars up and away from him.  Why?  Obtrusive camera movement is justified only if it adds to our understanding of character or plot.  This shot seems to have been included merely for its cleverness.  The same is true of the little flashes of black-and-white which keep interrupting the action.  At one point, in a dialogue between Nixon and Haldeman, the focus is un-subtly and repeatedly thrown from one man to the other.  What does this achieve?  Is some artistic goal being pursued, or are the effects included for their own sake?  What is the symbolic importance (if any) of the vanishing racehorses?Much of the attention to detail is of a very high order.  Stone\'s writing team has done its homework, and we get authentic touches such as Nixon\'s love of log fires, which meant having to run the White House air conditioning system at full blast during summer.  The reconstructions of the White House interiors are superb.  We see Nixon and Pat engaging in a domestic scrap beneath murals of more edifying battles like Yorktown and Saratoga.  Historical events, recorded on news film at the time, are brilliantly reconstituted, replacing the real Nixon with the Hopkins version.  Thus we get convincing reconstructions of the Kennedy TV debate and the 1962 \'retirement\' speech.  Young Nixon\'s courtship of Pat is narrated without dialogue as a grainy, jumpy home movie - and is beautifully done.  I did not feel quite so positive about the Alger Hiss segment. Welles did this \'newsreel flashback\' idea in ""Citizen Kane"" more than half a century earlier, and did it with such flair that anything which follows is sure to look jaded.  It also seemed to me that this passage is badly-placed, coming immediately after the 1962 California defeat.James Wood plays Bob Haldeman, and does his usual admirable, photogenic best.  My quibble with the characterisation is, this isn\'t THE Haldeman. The historical personage was grimmer, more stately, more formidable (Fred Emery\'s ""Watergate"" bears this out).  Wood is restricted here to the role of an aide, rather than the Chief of the White House Staff, an emperor within his own (not inconsiderable) domain.Pat Nixon does not ring true either, but for different reasons.  Joan Allen is more than competent as the steely, astute power behind the Nixon throne.  The fault is in the characterisation rather than the actor.  The real Pat was (so far as one can judge) an altogether less articulate, less philosophical, less knowing individual.  Watch her in the REAL ""Checkers"" broadcast - she is a stiff, repressed, passive woman, a true 1950\'s Republican wife, not the power broker that this film would have us believe. It is hard to accept, for example, that Nixon\'s decision to retire in 1962 was his wife\'s diktat.There are elements of this otherwise excellent film which simply don\'t work.  Would the President of the United States REALLY be pulled out of a face-to-face meeting with Brezhnev to deal with some Watergate minutiae? The real-life Mitchell said that he tolerated Martha\'s indiscretions ""because I love her"".  This touching declaration is cheapened in the film, for no good reason.  Similarly, Tricia Nixon\'s exchange with her father was, in real life, an assertion of unconditional loyalty which was both moving and very much to Nixon\'s credit.  The film version has her asking sceptically, ""Did you cover up?""  This is quite wrong.  The Nixon women would have considered it treachery even to frame such a question.John Williams\' epic score is in keeping with the classical tragedy acted out before us.  Nixon\'s tearful prayer with Kissinger and the farewell speech to the White House staff are scenes of extraordinary power.Paul Sorvino gives us a marvellous Kissinger, though in my humble opinion Stone goes too far when he makes Kissinger the White House \'leaker\' and accuses the Secretary of State of complicity in the Watergate break-ins.One scene which works splendidly is the (true) incident at the Lincoln Memorial.  Nixon tries to glad-hand the indignant youngsters, using the hearty, patronising approach of a bygone generation.  The sad revulsion of the protesters shows the gulf between Nixon\'s consciousness and the spirit of the age.""I hope I haven\'t let you down"" is uttered one single time by Nixon, towards the end of the film.  The truth is, he hit on this formula of words and used it again and again during the final days of his presidency.  It was a last desperate attempt to tweak our sympathy-nodes.  As such, it was utterly gauche, utterly craven, utterly guileful, yet utterly unrealistic. In fact, utterly Nixon.', 'Richard Nixon is one of the most controversial heads of state of the twentieth century. During his tenure as president of the United States, he earned a general hatred almost as high as the power and influence of his office. He was investigated, vilified, attacked but never condemned. Even though I\'m not an American nor an expert of these period, I feel it is necessary to make an unbiased and objective historical analysis of this president, I just don\'t know if that has already happened. Even so, the film we have here didn\'t seem partial, trying to remain neutral to some extent.Directed by Oliver Stone, it\'s not appropriate for people who don\'t know anything about Nixon, or Watergate, or this period of American history, since the film wasn\'t wasting time explaining anything. So if you didn\'t understand why Nixon opened the US to China or what was the Watergate or the Bay of Pigs, I suggest you ignore the movie for now and first go read some books or see some documentaries about it. Another problem I want to highlight is the huge web of conspiracies and obscure theories that the film weaves around the president. It never lets us understand what ""crimes of responsibility"" Nixon has committed. The film also suggests, without subtleties, that Nixon was a simple man who rose in life but wasn\'t accepted by the ""American aristocracy"" because of this humble origin, which left him deeply hurt. I don\'t know if it\'s true, but the film indicates that as origin of President\'s lack of scruples.Anthony Hopkins assures the main role in an interesting performance, but that\'s far from being his best. He made a good preparation and tried his best to be Nixon, but has few physical similarities with him, not to mention his extreme difficulty in imitating president\'s characteristic voice. Anyway, Hopkins was brilliant at his character\'s psychological work, with most dramatic scenes going on as he, semi-drunk, reviews his decisions while listening to his famous audio tapes. The remaining cast does a reasonable supporting work. I will not close my review without left a word of appreciation to the sets and costumes, which rebuilt the atmosphere and culture of the Seventies quite well, much like the rooms and offices within White House. Not being exceptional, it\'s an elegant, quality film, that helps us think about an important period in American history.']"
14,15,112760,1408.0,"['""Cutthroat Island"" is a 1995 film with chaotic production and distribution and with unfair reviews of the professional critics. Renny Harlin and Geena Davis were married at that time and he convinced the producers to cast his wife in an action film in a complete misevaluation of her talent. Geena Davis was a great actress in comedy and drama genres in the 80´s and 90´s but was only reasonable in the role of the female pirate Morgan Adams. Another problem was to find an actor for Morgan´s slave William Shaw since Matthew Modine was the last choice in a long list of actors that refused the role. It seems that this notorious film was also the responsible for the bankruptcy of Carolco Pictures since the box office was frustrating.Said that, ""Cutthroat Island"" is indeed an entertaining modern (in 1995) pirate movie, with a good story. The successful franchize ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is an improvement of ""Cutthroat Island"" with better technology, budget and cast. But the stories are equaly entertaining and funny. In the end, forget the bad ratings of professional critics and have a goodtime watching this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Ilha da Garganta Cortada"" (""The Cutthroat Island"")', ""The film opens in Jamaican coast in 1668While the Port Royal governor wants so badly the lady pirate, Morgan Adams, and will pay well for her, Dawg Brown (Frank Langella) was grabbing Morgan's father Black Harry (Harris Yulin) to take the first piece of a map (split into three separate pieces) to Cutthroat Island, where a treasure of a Spanish gold ship is said to be buried thereEach of the other sections of the map is held by Morgan's two uncles: Dawg-the bad pirate who doesn't want to share the treasure-has the second piece stolen from a now-deceased brother, and Mordachai holds the third at Spittlefied HarborSo to seek the Spanish Treasure and to avenge her father's death, Morgan (Geena Davis) has to join with her uncle Mordachai and fight her murderous uncle to obtain the third part of the mapThe governor of the island (Patrick Malahide) offers Morgan two alternatives: One, an ignominious death on the gallows or she might cut him in for a share of her grandfather's treasureAt the slave market, Morgan was looking for a man who can read Latin So she picked a handsome convict who passes himself off as a physician with a natural pitch for music and a perfect taste in wine His name was William Shaw (Matthew Modine).If you enjoy Seventeenth Century pirate movies, and like to see how 92 million dollars were spent in sea-battles, rope-swinging, slow motion swashbuckling action, cannons with many explosions and many fires, plenty of rum, cove and cliffs, lots of treasure, the destruction of two Jamaican towns, gorgeous ocean vistas and breathtaking visuals don't miss this one!"", ""Cutthroat Island is a movie that you can just sit back, relax and watch it with a big goofy grin on your face.  Sure it tanked at the box office, but don't disregard it totally.  It's entertaining as hell.  Geena Davis is rather engaging as a female pirate and Frank Langella seemed to be enjoying himself.  Most people will say that this movie can't hold a candle to the pirate films of Errol Flynn, and they're right.  But for a rock em sock em pirate adventure with more explosions than the high seas ever saw, watch Cutthroat Island."", 'Making a valiant stab at becoming an action figure, Geena Davis plays Morgan Adams, a wily, rough & tumble pirate woman who lives for adventure and the like. When her evil Uncle Dawg (Frank Langella) turns on her and her dad, it\'s a race against time for Morgan as she tries to piece together a map that will lead her to Cut-Throat Island, where unimaginable wealth in stolen pirate gold resides. Along the way she is pursued by an evil British officer who goes into cahoots with treacherous crew members and Dawg, aided by a pretty boy Jack-of-all-trades thief named William Shaw (Matthew Modine), and confronted with a series of wildly over the top set pieces that no human being could possibly survive. One of the most expensive flops ever made, this overlong but endearing and even occasionally exciting film deserved much better than what it got in the summer of the mid-90s. Not quite as funny as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" but still fun. Already a cardboard cut-out role to begin with, Geena Davis struggles to overcome her natural aura of motherly warmth to play the roughish Morgan, but she plays the part well enough (she really does come across as somebody\'s mother, albeit the kind of mother neighborhood boys fantasize about). It\'s easy to imagine her in the ring with Keira Knightley - who played Elizabeth Swann in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - and to have Geena walloping Keira\'s waif like frame. Matthew Modine has his moments as Shaw and Frank ""Dracula/Skeletor"" Langella is enjoyably hammy as Dawg.If nothing else, rent it for the expensive sets, fancy costumes, and elaborate, over the top stunts - many of which Davis and Modine did themselves.', ""This film was responsible for the bankruptcy of the company behind it, Carolco. Which is a shame, but the film is not as bad as it is rumoured to be. Far from it. It's above average oldfashioned entertainment.The soundtrack alone is a standout. Sweeping and powerful, it serves the plotline well and it's a joy to listen to on its own. Although the characters aren't among the most complex and well defined in movie history, they work (with a couple of exceptions, among them Maury Chaykin as John Reed, whose acting just doesn't match the tone of the film). And then there's the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships, well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects.\nIn short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time.

Being a woman certainly doesn\'t stop Morgan Adams (Geena Davis) from plundering and ""manning"" the high seas. Sure, she\'s a bit incredible at first, but this movie is more about the classic treasure-hunt adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson than any life realities. Just look at the success of Pirates of the Caribbean! At least this movie is far more realistic than that, without any curses and such and...sadly, without the prizewinning role played by Depp. Davis does manage to lend credence to the part of a strong woman who still maintains some rules and beliefs in her pirating. She is the daughter of a pirate captain. Her father is murdered by her uncle, Dawg (Frank Langella), in his search for a mysterious treasure. Apparently, several of the family members each carried a piece of the map to this treasure but none of them wanted to share it and thus, it has remained unfound. Morgan begins a journey to get that which is rightfully her\'s and her shipmates, all while being pursued by the British navy, her uncle, and amorously pursued by a professional thief, William Shaw (Matthew Modine).

Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn\'t have much excitement. I guess also because I\'m a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe\'s. When they work together, they create masterpieces. I\'ve read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this ""Goodfells Part 2"". Is it ""Goodfellas Part 2"", in my opinion, no. Yes, it\'s very similar situations, but it\'s not the same plot. It\'s a little more gory and more bright. ""Casino"" is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro\'s character says ""It\'s more like Disney Land now"". Actually that\'s true, it\'s not like it used to be. I\'m only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60\'s and 70\'s. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta\'s in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I\'m a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He\'s dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he\'s a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too: the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He\'s only 5\' 6\'\', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. ""You want me to get out of my own town?! Don\'t *bleep* with me, Ace!"" Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we\'re talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my ""Rober DeNiro: A history of his films"" that Sharon over shined both Joe\'s and Robert\'s performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has ""hired"" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace ""I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I\'m not protecting you anymore!"", you get scarred and can\'t help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what\'s coming to her, that\'s what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I\'m telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song ""Gimme Shelter"" by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I\'m disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. Whew. ""Casino"" is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don\'t compare this to ""Goodfellas"", let it stand on it\'s own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It\'s very violent, we\'re talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there\'s more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It\'s a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250. I\'d like to see it in the top 100, but we\'ll see. 10/10', 'I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching ""Casino"" for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.The film is unusual in that it has two leading men with parallel stories. Sometimes Ace and Nicky (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) were in scenes together....often they were apart...each doing his own thing. As for Ace, he was a smart man who was in charge of one of Vegas\' top casinos. He was tough...but basically honest for a mobster. As for Nicky, as you\'d expect with a Joe Pesci character, he\'s a bit of a nut-job....often out of control and letting anger govern most of his decisions. Unlike Ace who had a veneer of honesty about him, Nicky was a hood...and didn\'t mind this. Eventually, the pair end up having a downfall. How and what happens to each you\'ll have to see for yourself.The parts of this film I enjoyed the most were when you learned about how Vegas operated. Seeing Ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting. And, in this sense, I enjoyed the film much more than ""Goodfellas""...also with the same stars and same director. This is because ""Goodfellas"" was mostly just about violence and crime...whereas ""Casino"" seemed to have more story and wasn\'t always about excessive violence and nastiness...not that the film is in any way a \'nice\' picture. It\'s filled with obscenities, nasty folks and a few scenes of horrific violence. Think about this before you decide whether or not to see the movie.By the way, this is only a personal choice and doesn\'t really affect the movie much, but one thing I did not love about the film is the omnipresent pop music....which at times made the film seem like a music video. I think less of this would have been nice.', 'I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former\'s flaws.Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated.Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob\'s casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There\'s divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky\'s wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don\'t change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can\'t turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace\'s fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man\'s escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.4/4', 'A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese\'s Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas\' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it\'s fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.', 'Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese ""Casino"" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas\x85 We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn\'t sleep day or night\x85 De Niro\'s character, Sam \'Ace\' Rothstein, is based on Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper\x85 He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country\x85 Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them\x85 As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys\x85 \'Ace\' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tables\x85But he had a fatal flaw\x85 \'Ace\' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions\x85 So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him\x85 Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, \'Ace\' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power\x85 Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating\x85 Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town\x85 For her, a guy like \'Ace\' was the ultimate score\x85 So the way to Ginger\'s heart was clearly money\x85 \'Ace\' knew that but he didn\'t care\x85What he wanted was to marry her\x85 Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild\x85 She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desires\x85Joe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn\'t afraid of the cops\x85 He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer\x85 (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.) To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with \'Ace\' or didn\'t give him the proper respect\x85 Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that \'Ace\' didn\'t get his hands dirty\x85 \'Ace\' witnessed several beatings on his behalf\x85 Nicky\'s mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcer\x85The clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening\x85 They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story\x85 \'Ace\' was an extremely fastidious guy\x85 And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic', 'Martin Scorsese\'s Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It\'s got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it\'s all there. Furthermore, it\'s got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn\'t a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an ""I\'m a schmo"" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it\'s runtime, and it\'s easy to forgive the flaws when you\'re watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who\'s head he\'s jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it\'s fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It\'s not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn\'t as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino\'s influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in \'cool\' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac\'s ""Go Your Own Way"" and The Animals\' ""The House of the Rising Sun"" are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro\'s last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie ""Heat"". On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It\'s an entertaining ride, but it\'s one that is ultimately shallow.', 'I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the ""great film"" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can\'t stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese\'s normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.\nScorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I\'m a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn\'t just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of ""Satisfaction"" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.  Being a complete film geek, I generally don\'t go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I\'d seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I\'m sure I\'ll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly', ""If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem."", 'Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a amazing movie with unforgettable performances.The film portrays Las Vegas at a time when it was dominated by the mafia, extremely well directed by Scorsese, that film shows Robert De Niro as manager of the Tangiers Casino who have to deal with his unstable wife that used to be a high-class prostitute but who can not forget her pimp Lester and with his childhood friend Nicky that is taking the city with extreme uncontrolled violence bringing a bad image to the plans that the mafia has in Las Vegas.Sharon Stone definitely give the best performance of her career in this film and the secondary characters convey very well the image of the great leaders of the mafia.Casino is a classic and a must-see movie.']"

But who would have expected such a miracle from her in the screenwriting department? Some of the most dramatic moments in 'Sense and Sensibility' come from her pen, not Jane Austen's, difficult as that may be to believe. For instance, the scene in which Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) carries in the ill Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet), echoing the earlier scene where Willoughby (Greg Wise) brought the injured young woman home was Thompson's doing. Marianne's illness also is responsible for much more drama in the movie than in the book. And I'm an Austen fan! I can't recall another writer bringing so much good of his or her own to a classic like this.I suppose the director, cinematographer, production designer, etc. deserve to share the credit when a movie is this outstanding, but with such a super group of actors on the screen (from top to bottom) it's easy to heap all the praise on them. I had unconsciously (and unfairly) pigeonholed Alan Rickman based on the other role I'd seen him in, the villain in 'Die Hard,' so he was quite a surprise to me. The real bombshell, however, was my first exposure to Kate Winslet. After seeing this movie and Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' I can say I can't remember another young actress who has impressed me so much. And she played these difficult roles by the time she was 20! Many of the other cast members are a part of an excellent group that Thompson and Branagh have often worked with in the past.I realized that 'S&S' had become one of my all-time favorite movies when I found myself watching it every chance I got when it came on TV. I think it's bumped 'Raging Bull' off my personal top 10 list."", ""Wow, here's an emotional story that gets you involved and wears you out by the end. I wears you out not from action, but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer: (1) Emma Thompson and (2) incredible visuals.Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensible-sweet-wholesome and pretty and-always unfairly ignored woman than Thompson (see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End). Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive.. Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I've ever seen on film. This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it. It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing, too - a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom, Titantic.One tip that I found useful in watching this movie. If you are not British, you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England, in which this story takes place.The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals. This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen, on both the inside and outside scenes. It's just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors. Nice music score, too.This kind of story is a bit too soap opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it's still very much worth seeing, and adding to one's DVD collection. It''s great film-making."", 'I haven\'t read the book (yet), but concerning the film as it is, I can assure you that it is very well made. You\'ll get one of the best period dramas (I wouldn\'t go all the way with ""best ever"", but then again, I don\'t often use extremes to describe a movies) that you have seen! Of course you have to be open to this kind of movie. Meaning, that if you\'re more likely to watch Bruce Willis in Die Hard or can\'t wait for the next Steven Seagal movie, this might not be your cup of tea! There is a strong possibility that you won\'t like (to watch) this movie at all.So if you have seen period dramas and like them, than watch this one too, if you haven\'t watched one yet, than this can be a perfect movie to start with (although some might say, it\'s downhills after that ;o) )', 'What an excellent film! Superb performances, spellbinding dialogue, and beautiful sets and props led to an enchanting 2 hours of lost love and hope. I loved the stiffly formal, wonderfully polite, yet stifling mores these English were forced to endure. In many cases their lives were not their own to live; in many, their lives were lived under the gun of the almighty buck. They carried right on, however, with their characteristically stiff English upper lip, come what may. Great film with a knockout ending.', 'If it wasn\'t for Jane Austen\'s novels and their screen-adaptation, we wouldn\'t be much familiar with the English gallantry and the bourgeois manners of the early 19th century. Her oeuvre encapsulated a time where women didn\'t have a way to go through life without landing on the ""marriage"" square, hardly an issue to please feminists but who would call Austen traditional or submissive for all that? She respected the conventions but made powerful social commentaries in the indirect sense that her female protagonists never married someone they didn\'t love. Marriage was the end, but love was the means to achieve it, while marriage of convenience was the privilege of the mediocre ones.Now, there is an interesting point of comparison between her two most celebrated novels: ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"". ""Sense"" was Austen\'s first success, written at a very young age, yet it deals with characters evolving in the realm of adulthood, while in ""Pride"", written by an older Austen, the heroines are the Bennett Sisters who aren\'t older than twenty. It is just like Austen was a painter who had to go to the top of the mountain to have a clear view on a plain after having painted the mountain from the plain. With enough experience and wisdom, she was able to make a brighter portrait of a young generation who get the man through their actions. In ""Sense"", the Dashwood sisters are fully-dimensional characters, Elinor (Emma Thompson) is reserved and introverted while Marianne (Kate Winslet) is romantic and flamboyant, they\'re more mature than the Bennetts sisters, but at the expense of their reactivity.In ""Pride"", luck and men\'s valiance were not elements to count on, and many round trips allowed the heroine to confront her suitor. It is possible that ""Pride"" was a bit too modern while ""Sense"" was more obedient to the perception of women\'s role at the time (rather static), but the directing by Ang Lee and the screenplay worked in such a way that the quest for marriage isn\'t actually the most interesting part of the film. And while I don\'t think I give away the ending by saying that each one will find the true love, it\'s obviously not the point of suspense; the real question is how these people interact. And just like your typical Austen\'s stories, there\'s a good deal of passions and deception, or romantic studs popping up at the right moment and forcing the women to all align in the house to promptly welcome their host. Some are dark and brooding (Alan Rickman) other shy and amiable (Hugh Grant) and a few too perfect to be true (Greg Wise) but they all have one thing in common, they\'re conveniently called to office in London whenever marriage seems too close, a snobby bitch or karma playing the same game postponing the overdue rendezvous with destiny.But as predictable as these films are, their quality is elsewhere, starting with the acting. Literary movies have this quality that the abundance of words and plots can sometimes distract from simpler moments that actually elevate them more than any monologue or speech. This moment occurs when Edward (Grant), is ready to confess something to Elinor. They have spent enough time together to grow a deep feeling. He\'s about to say something about his\x85 you expect the word ""feeling"", he says ""education"", and you can see something click in the blink of an eye in Thompson\'s face, \'devastation\' as it would really show in a woman who learned to hide her feelings. There\'s no doubt that Emma Thompson is one of the greatest actress of her generation. On the other hand, Marianne will also face abandon and the reaction will fit her passionate personality. While, the plot in itself can be summed up by women waiting for the right men to come, so (God forbid), they don\'t end up as bitter spinster, there is more to enjoy, the text and more importantly, the subtext.And on that level, Jane Austen\'s stories are exhilarating hymns for eloquence and literacy, whether when the characters write intimate correspondences, share their personal thoughts with their friends or relatives or try to convey a strong message by still respecting the conveniences, I just can\'t resist by the way Shakespeare\'s language is being honored. You finish the film and you just want to express your feelings with the same economy of obviousness or flamed passion when called for, and a similar urge generally invade me when I finish the Ivory and Merchant movies. There is something just irresistible in these British heritage films, they make you realize how close we still are to these times by the scale of history, but light-years ahead as far as mediocrity and plainness is concerned.And it\'s a credit to Austen\'s writing and Thompsons\'s rewriting (earning her an Oscar) to have translated the story in a tone that wouldn\'t make feminists\' neck hair stand up and wouldn\'t portray men as misogynistic pigs.The film says something important: the strength of your character doesn\'t depend on what he or she accomplishes but how it can strongly affect your own feeling or how can they resist the cruelties of life without necessarily triumphing over them. All through the film, I was totally rooting for Marianne, Elinor, their mother (Gemma Jones) and the way they endorsed or rebelled against conventions at crucial times where simpler things were complicatedly expressed. Indeed, everything that happened is due to something said, a promise or a misunderstanding. It\'s all in the way words are used, misused or distorted and that\'s one of the many delights in this lavish movie.', 'It\'s not easy to get seniors to do anything, even watch a movie and when you mention Jane Austen, they zone out. Yet each year when we do this film in class, about 80 percent end up loving it and that includes the guys. It\'s wonderful to watch them respond to the characters and get into a film that is so ""talky"" when they have been used to high action. To hear the girls call Willoughby a jerk and applaud Brandon at the end is great, but to listen to the boys comment on the behavior of the various characters is even better. How they respond to a society so filled with strict manners and codes of behavior also makes this film worthwhile and it generates much discussion about the importance of money in life; well, even Thompson in the commentary said the film is about money, who has it and who does not. I love showing this film to my students; after the groans when I start it on the first day, it\'s wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish. As one senior male said this year, ""I wouldn\'t have rented this or wanted to see it, but now that I have, I admit it was pretty good, so I\'m glad you showed it."" This is why they are classics, kiddies.', 'I found ""Sense and Sensibilty"" to be one of the most charming movies I have seen since ""Finding Neverland"". It has a very warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990\'s, all of Jane Austen\'s huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay, which was also her first. Kudos to her, she seems like a fine and intelligent woman. I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn\'t translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen\'s letters and put them into the movie.The acting is absolutely on key and all of the actors fit quite well into their roles. I enjoy period pieces thourelly, if you don\'t, you might want to skip it. But I would recommend this picture any day. It\'s very beautiful and a wonderful movie to watch. It has some of the finest British actors: Allen Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant. So give it a chance, I think you\'ll be pleasantly surprised.10/10', 'This is a remarkable film that does a very good job of depicting a rigid and quite hidebound society that often made India\'s caste system look reasonable and moderate by comparison.  One of the more enjoyable points for me was the fact that the ""sense and sensibility"" of the title had a most definite 19th Century feel and yet still remains very timeless and does not attempt to force Twentieth Century mores (probably by use of a crowbar) into a script where they do not belong.  Modern day viewpoints do not belong here.  If you want a modern day version, fine.  But it would be, at best, only a glancing and quite loose adaptation of the novel, so why do an adaptation at all, then?  Not all films have to reflect present day sensibilities.  This is a very human and compelling story with a fine cast and wonderfully witty script.  Look for a very dry and understated performance by Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, the long-suffering husband of the daughter of Mrs. Jennings. Were I Mr. Palmer, I\'d have long since invested in earplugs or opened a vein.  Very fine film and most highly recommended.', ""This is one of the best of the recent Jane Austen films, from one of her weaker books. Emma Thompson has done a fine job of the script, not slavishly remaining faithful to the book but not abandoning it either.The cast are uniformally excellent. I especially liked Kate Winslet's Marianne and Alan Rickman's Brandon. Emma Thompson's performance is almost good enough to make you forget that she is far to old for the part. The supporting cast are all excellent.Ang Lee's direction shows the same skill that it did in the excellent Eat Drink Man Woman and the scenery and costumes are beautiful (perhaps too beautiful).This is more romantic and less comic than say Emma, and Thompson's script wisely stays away from the kind of set-piece gags seen in the recent film of Emma. All in all, this is excellent.""]"
17,18,113101,5.0,"[""It's a pity that the critics gave 'Four Rooms' as hard a time as they did back in 1995, because, for everything that can be said to be wrong with it, it really does sparkle with creativity and a desire to stand out from the rest of the crowd. And let's face it, there was enough popular talent involved, including Alison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and, last but not least, Quentin Tarantino, for it to have been hailed as an instant cult classic. Instead, it was bashed into submission and retreated very quickly to the back of nearly everyone's resume. With retrospect most of this reproach was probably ill-deserved - 'Four Rooms' does have its blatant moments of weakness, but then again so do a lot of the more half-baked cookie-cutter comedies which have somehow garnered more admiration than this. On the whole it's a very unusual and interesting combination - an offbeat, frisky and strangely feel-good comedy with some sinister undertones and lots of weird, intricate little details. Consisting of four 20-minute segments, each assembled by a different director's hands, it takes us through the various happenings inside separate rooms of the same hotel on New Year's Eve, as experienced by Ted, the only bellhop still left standing for the night shift. There is the slight feeling of inconsistency in moving from one directing style to the next, and a couple of attempts to interconnect the segments are a little self-contradictory. Some of it works and some it doesn't, but the end result is an episodic anthology that, if nothing too spectacular, still proves itself to be very likable in the long run.'The Missing Ingredient' and 'the Wrong Man' are often credited with constituting the weaker half of the film, and I can't really say I disagree. 'The Missing Ingredient' tries hard to be risqué, but falls pretty short - for a story concerning a coven of bare-breasted witches trying to extract an unwilling man's semen for use in a ritual, it's remarkably innocuous and fluffy, and the visual effects only add a layer of tackiness to boot. 'The Wrong Man' is a tad more snappy and sports some stylish direction (the shot where Sigfried grabs the ringing telephone is right-on), but is ultimately swallowed up in its frenzied editing. We can vaguely understand what's happening in this segment (if not, then Ted does drop a pretty big hint later on in the film), but it makes itself unnecessarily incoherent, with bizarre imagery that adds nothing but extra confusion (the baby flashback, anyone?). It's almost as though Alexandre Rockwell isn't sure whether he wants us to be in on the whole set-up with Sigfried and Angela, or confused and in the dark like Ted, and in the end tries to accommodate both perspectives, which doesn't really wash.It's once we reach the second half that the true quality really starts to seep its way in, and the film suddenly becomes very rewarding. 'The Misbehaviours' is a spirited little contribution that combines a moderate dose of macabre darkness with its cartoon-like innocence. Antonio Banderas certainly hits a good spot as the no-nonsense father who appoints Ted to keep an eye on his two young children while he's out, whilst the children themselves are rebellious but not irritating, all making for a surprisingly sharp and sophisticated slice of knockabout. 'The Man from Hollywood', meanwhile, is equally brilliant - Tarantino's vibrant, well-scripted take on Roald Dahl's chilling short story, 'the Man from the South', which pits Ted in the same room as cocky Hollywood director Chester Rush (and it's always a treat to see Quentin himself tackle such a winking, self-depreciating role). It manages to be tense and enjoyable, with the usual smart direction that any Tarantino fan should be able to appreciate. Overall, there's enough vitality in these particular segments to just about redeem the shakiness of the first half.Besides, we have Tim Roth playing our hapless protagonist throughout, and, yes, that is a lot. He proves himself to be very capable in a comic performance, bringing enough gentle magnetism to his character Ted the bellhop, through his good intentions, perseverance and various neurotic mannerisms, to get us genuinely attached to him. It is hard not to come away with the impression that all four directors had a slightly different take on Ted's disposition - he goes from being timid and impressionable to obtuse and jumpy, then highly-strung and a little devious, and finally composed and relatively rational - but Roth does well in single-handedly bridging these gaps and, with the many mishaps his character has to endure over the course of the night, ensures that all changes in temper seem understandable. He retains his good-natured lovability for the entire running time, and, for anyone who can really relate to poor Ted (like yours truly), he'll have you rooting for him to the very satisfying end.To my knowledge, there was never any other film quite like 'Four Rooms' and, judging by just how unwelcome this one was made to feel when it arrived, there probably won't be another for quite some time. It remains an ambitious and not entirely successful little sleeper, but has a good deal going for it nonetheless, and I urge all fans of Tarantino, Rodriguez and Roth in particular not to be put off by the bad press and to give it a chance. Who knows? One day, it might just make a fresh start and find the cult audience that appreciates it yet."", 'Four Rooms was concocted like one of those many, many collaborative efforts from directors in the 60\'s and 70\'s (i.e. The Witches, Ro.Go.PaG, Boccaccio \'70, etc), except this would revolve around a bell-hop on New Years Eve. It disqualifies itself as being any kind of masterpiece or classic in independent film-making, and sometimes the filmmakers (Alison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Alexandre Rockwell, and Quentin Tarantino, the last two also serving as executive producer) look like they\'re relishing too much in their (limited) clout and exuberance to concentrate. As was with many others who viewed the film, I found that the first two segments were the lesser ones, and the last two were the best ones. It all comes down, in this case, to which two were funnier. So, let\'s break each one down:Allison Anders\' film is a quirky, quasi-lesbian take on a coven of witches, featuring the likes of Madonna and Lily Taylor, are the first to shake up (perhaps for the better in this one) Ted the bell-hop. Ted, by the way, is played with a continuous, nervous-type of fervor that goes from being innocuous, to annoying, and then acceptable again. It\'s also interesting to see how his character goes through different motions when under each director (for example, in Rodriguez\'s film he\'s more of a cartoon-type of character, and in Tarantino\'s film he hearkens slightly to his previous collaborations with the director, quieter, on edge in a particular way). Some of the laughs are surrounded by a kind of attitude put forth by the director that seems a little off. Maybe I\'m the wrong audience for it, though- the women in the audience may appreciate it, or rather amused by it, more than I. I give it a B-Alexandre Rockwell\'s The Wrong Man is my least favorite of the bunch, as Ted gets stuck with a couple of crazed fetishists (David Proval and Jennifer Beals). The problem here lies with two things- the fact that the comedic timing/chemistry is a little iffy/off with the three actors, and that the writing doesn\'t come off like it\'s naturally funny. When Beals\' character Angela runs off about Ted\'s private parts, this could be funny, but it\'s more \'ho-ho\' than \'ha-ha\' to me. Some of the tension from Roth brings some laughs, but not enough to compensate the uncomfortable atmosphere around the whole segment. I give it a C-The third segment, The Misbehaviors, displays how clever and quick Rodriguez can be with physical comedy (slapstick) as well as in getting laughs from kids (as he did here and there in his Spy Kids movies). It is also a boost that the whole segment comes off as though it\'s like a live-action Looney Tunes short- it\'s so ridiculous that in some scenes I burst out laughing (i.e. Ted\'s reaction to the corpse). The set-up with the parents was also amusing in how Banderas and Tamlyn Tomita act towards the kids. Then the pay-off knocks it out of the park. Grade: AThen we come to the closure, featuring the indie wunderkind at the time, Tarantino, as he takes on two sources of inspiration- Rohald Dahl\'s ""Man from the South"" short story, later translated through Alfred Hitchcock\'s television show. It\'s a smart, hip little piece of Hollywood satire from Tarantino, as he himself plays an overly obnoxious Hollywood filmmaker, with two guys by his side (Paul Calderon and Bruce Willis), as they take a gamble right after the stroke of midnight. It took me a couple of time to watch this to really get into it, but when I did it was even more promising. The camera-work in the scene (via \'Dogs\' and \'Pulp\' cinematographer Andrzej Sekula) is deliberately paced, and it\'s perfectly leisurely for the pace of the last segment. That much, if not all, of the dialog is funny it\'s because of the skill and chemistry between the four of them. Plus, a little prologue with Marisa Tomei and Kathy Griffin gives the indication of what insanity is in store. Grade- A.So, is this film a success? For it\'s time, I\'m not sure. With the power of four million off the success of each director\'s previous efforts (Tarantino with \'Dogs\', Rodriguez with El Mariachi, Anders with Gas, Food, and Lodging, and Rockwell with In the Soup, all from the 92 Sundance place), they did whatever they wanted, and it\'s not the success it could\'ve been. On the other hand, when one looks at the films in perspective, it could\'ve been a lot worse, and it wasn\'t. At the least, it works as one of the quintessential party movies for fans of the 90\'s ""new-wave"" crop.', 'It\'s impossible to analyze this film without breaking it down into its four segments for separate comment.  It would also be improper, since it was not intended to be anything less than an anthology from four notable independent filmmakers:  Alexandre Rockwell, Alison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino.The first episode is exactly the sort of thing that someone in a high school drama production would want to do, but can\'t get away with in a high school drama production.  It\'s juvenile, unfunny, and lifeless, but it has the (pointless) nudity and lines of dialogue like:Witch #1:  ""I am your mother.""Witch #2:  ""Then why are we sleeping together?""that sound like the screenwriter is giggling and thinking, ""I can\'t believe I\'m getting away with this!  I\'m so clever!""Nothing is at stake in the first episode;  it\'s generally expected that a story must have conflict in order to BE a story.  This has none.  Just some half-baked jokes and a pair of topless women (If I wanted that, I\'d skip renting a movie and go out instead.)Second episode is a hair better, but you\'ll find yourself crying ""Why doesn\'t Ted the Bellboy do [insert plot resolution here] and get the bloody hell out of there!""  When it finally does end, you\'re disheartened to find that it had no reason to exist.  Two snips with a pair of scissors,  a bit of tape, and we wouldn\'t know the difference.  Roll opening credits, go straight to the Rodriguez segment.Third episode has some structural support to keep it from caving in on itself.  The surprise in the middle (I won\'t give it away, don\'t worry) is horrifying enough to give the segment some heft.  Rodriguez and his d.p., Guillermo Navarro, move it along dexterously and (as usual) have a good handle on visual comedy.The last segment is the best.  I think it\'s safe to say that Quentin Tarantino has, officially, never disappointed me as a director or screenwriter.  My heart leapt as soon as I heard his trademark dialogue coming from the lips of Marisa Tomei as ""Four Rooms"" segued from ""The Misbehavers"" to ""The Man From Hollywood.""  I wasn\'t sure if his take on Ted the Bellhop\'s misadventures was going to be any good, but I knew that if he wrote it and helmed it, it wasn\'t going to be all bad.What a pleasant surprise (still just talking about the fourth segment here). This part of the movie, with its ridiculous premise (lifted form an old Hitchcock episode, which it acknowledges out loud), moves along speedily, and the actors take to it as naturally as any other movies by Q.T. Basically playing himself, Tarantino is hilarious.  If anything, he knows A) how people really act when they\'re drunk (i.e. not like Dudley Moore caricatures)  B) why people think he\'s so obnoxious, like a real-life, fast-talking Jar Jar Binks and  C) how to put some bang in his visual storytelling.  It\'s low-rent Tarantino, don\'t get me wrong, but it\'s also the best part of ""Four Rooms.""All in all, the first film I\'ve ever seen that starts out with a loathsome, horrifying badness, gets incrementally better with each passing fifteen minutes, and ends as good as one would like.  Just don\'t make me watch it again.', '""Four Rooms"" is far more entertaining than you would expect from its generally negative reviews. Which is not to say that any of it is a masterpiece but if you enjoyed ""Love American Style"" on television and are not put off by a raunchy take on that anthology concept you should make an effort to view this film. Each story is taking place in a different room of a hotel the same night. It was made between the time Tarantino made ""Pulp Fiction"" and worked on ""Dusk Till Dawn"" with Rodriquez. Many in the large cast are Tarantino and Rodriquez regulars. Here are a few of the reasons to watch each of the four stories:""The Missing Ingredient"" - Madona has simply never looked better and her ""come get me"" dress will burn your eyeballs. Alicia Witt plays her stock alienated teen and delivers sarcasm as only she can.""The Wrong Man"" – Alexander Rockwell directed this segment shortly after directing ""In the Soup"" so he already knew how to get the most out of Jennifer Beals. Her diatribe about Ted\'s sex organ is a cinema classic.""The Misbehavers"" – Rodriquez directs his favorite actor Antonio Banderas in something that is a throwback to classic Laurel and Hardy. Not only do his two kids misbehave when left alone in their hotel room, but their misbehavior is so comprehensive that the closing shot reveals a room of total anarchy. It is wonderful slapstick on a huge scale, with comic timing worthy of the Laural and Hardy and the Marx Brothers.""The Man From Hollywood"" – This has the best script with Tarantino reserving the best stuff for his own character. He even reprises the ""tasty beverage"" line from ""Pulp Fiction. Beals has already found her way to this room by the time bellboy Roth arrives and she delivers more good lines. I was impressed that Tarantino built up his suspense ""before"" the contest began and then did not try to extend the suspense but ended things on the first attempt.The best bit in the whole film might be Roth\'s phone call to his boss. Marisa Tomei answers the phone in a room full of comatose post-New Years Eve partygoers. She then does a version of her ""My Cousin Vinnie"" expert witness routine, this time concerning types of handguns. In the foreground the entire time are the only other conscious (but totally stoned) inhabitants of the room. They are playing against each other in a video game. One just stares in stunned fascination at the screen, holding the controller but not using it as the other player maniacally manipulates his controller throughout the entire phone conversation.', ""I really don't understand why this movie got such bad reviews!  Overall, this is a creative and refreshing movie.  It is not Pulp Fiction but it is still a good performance.  Tim Roth, especially, is the best thing in the film.  Out of the four I like Robert Rodguize's misbehavior the best.  The missing ingredient was indeed a bit cheesy but the rest are still above average performance.  If you are interested in this movie but discouraged by the movie critics, I ensure you that you won't regret seeing it."", ""Four Rooms, the 4 part directed, 4 part written mix-matched movie turns out to be an awesome combination. With Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino working on this film, you seem to expect a trigger-happy film festival with plenty of bombs and explosives to spare. But what the final product turns out to be is a laugh-out-loud comedy which follows a bellhop's mishaps one night as he scrambles to keep his hotel in order. Tim Roth is always a great performer and in this movie there is no difference. Kudos indeed."", 'Four Rooms (1995/Allison Anders; Alexandre Rockwell; Robert Rodriguez; Quentin Tarantino) **1/2 out of ****Welcome to the Mon Signor Hotel! Once a major hang out spot for movie stars of the 30\'s, 40\'s and first part of the 50\'s, it is now an out of date fire hazard, and it is falling apart! But on New Years Eve, a new bellhop will have the craziest night of his life in this very hotel.\nWhen I was thinking of Tarantino flicks to purchase, ""Four Rooms"" came to my mind. At first I was hesitant, and for good reason. After all, I had read nothing but bad reviews for this film. But what I found in it was a bizarre little comedy that wasn\'t so bad after all.""Four Rooms"" is an anthology film with four \'episodes\' about a fading hotel on News Years Eve, and with a quirky bellhop named Ted (Tim Roth) and his misadventures on this one crazy night. The first episode entitled ""The Missing Ingredient"" is about a group of witches staying in the hotel who need some sperm in order to complete a spell. And guess who knocks on the door...Ted the bellhop! The next episode, ""The Wrong Man"" is a shorter episode about Ted getting mistaken for another man. This is certainly the strangest of the episodes. Then next comes the hilarious ""The Misbehavers"". Ted is asked to babysit two kids of a Mexican gangster (Antonio Banderas in a parody of himself), and how everything possible can go wrong. And the final episode, ""The Man From Hollywood"" (the best) is directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is about a cocky Hollywood new-comer (Tarantino also in a parody of himself) who rents out the Penthouse for New Years Eve, and then plays a dangerous game that ends the film in a very funny way.I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this film. After reading all the bad reviews, I was afraid I wouldn\'t like this it, but it wasn\'t as bad as they said. Rent it if your curious or bored, but don\'t buy it expecting it to be like other Tarantino films. Not bad, not great, just average.-30-', ""Like many I got suckered into watching this film from the list of stars and director/writers (esp Tarantino) that participated in this exercise.I had no idea that it was *this* bad. It starts with the common thread, the bellboy, Tim Roth. It seemed like he was trying to be the British incarnation of Don Knotts trying to be Jerry Lewis. It was one of the most annoying and incomprehensibly bad performances, I've ever seen from a mainstream actor.He gets no help from what passes for plot. The first two stories seemed like they came from a 10 second pre-improv conference. The third plot was a shaggy dog story that could have worked had it been better executed and the fourth one, Tarantino's, to be fair actually sustained about 5 minutes of interest - unfortunately at the very end of the movie after 90+ minutes of endless torture.Those last 2 plots might have been worthwhile except for the smarmy self-indulgent performances of the stars. Tarantino is not as nearly as clever or funny as he thinks he is, and neither is Willis. The strongest performance might have been that of Banderas who almost rescued the third segment with his self-mocking playfulness.Overall, it felt like I was at one of those bad improv theatres where the actors know the only people in the audience are drunk/stoned friends, family and fanboys. If that doesn't describe you - stay far away from this mess. It really is *that* bad."", 'I seem to recall that when ""Four Rooms"" came out, it was critically and commercially derided. When I saw it a few months later, I actually thought that it was pretty well done. I knew that Quentin Tarantino was involved in the making, so I could safely assume that there was an element of sleaze in the movie.Well, the movie is likely to blow anyone away, just in terms of how far they go. Portraying bellhop Ted (Tim Roth) and his loony experiences on New Year\'s Eve while waiting on several people in a hotel, they blow everything out of the water. The first two segments are pretty lowbrow: the first one portrays a witches\' coven and the second one portrays a psychopath who thinks that Ted had sex with his wife.But when we get to the third segment, that\'s where the movie really takes off. Ted has to watch the children of a slick Mexican guy named Man (Antonio Banderas). After a few incidents, Man comes back and finds the room in the most mind-blowing scene imaginable. And, the last segment. Ted, in a totally frenetic state, goes to a room where several Hollywood guys are having a discussion (with as many curse words as possible). What happens at the end of that segment...well, let me just tell you that no one sees that coming! All in all, people who think that the movie didn\'t go anywhere obviously missed the point. I don\'t know for certain whether this movie was just an excuse to be crazy, but it sure seemed like that. You\'re sure to have fun watching it. Also starring Madonna, Valeria Golino, Jennifer Beals, Salma Hayek, and even Quentin Tarantino in the final segment playing a Hollywood type.']"
18,19,112281,9273.0,"['Despite most views of this movie, I thought it was just as good as (and in some aspects better than) the original.  Of course there was a lot  of recycled humor, but there was also a lot of original humor too.  I was a little bummed to find out that Courteney Cox wasn\'t returning in the second installment, but they did just fine without her.  I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see an Ace Ventura 3 someday.I thought the scene where Ace is trapped inside the animatronic rhino was the funniest scene in the movie, but the film is filled with other great scenes too.  I also loved the fact that he is a lover of all animals, except Bats.  I thought that was such a funny idea for the character.  I mean, what does that say about bats if a lover of all animals can\'t even stand them and finds them revolting.  Just thinking about it makes me laugh.  I just love the irony I guess.  Anyhow, there isn\'t much more I can say about this film other than if you liked ""Pet Detective"", you should see ""When Nature Calls"". ""Bumble-Bee Tuna"",-Chris', 'Is it dumb? Well, it\'s definitely low-brow, but it also has some gags that are undeniably clever. Is it racist? Yeah, a little, but it\'s also satirizing old stereotypes about ""Dark Africa."" Is it immature and and gross and sophomoric and over-the-top? Yes. Yes, it is.But someone (well, me) once said the only thing comedies have to be is funny. And this movie is dang funny. Need I remind anybody of the scene where Ace insists on dropping a slinky down the hundreds of steps leading up to a Buddhist temple? (""It was RIGHT there!"") Or the slideshow in which Ace\'s hand appears to greedily devour a poacher\'s crotch? That\'s just hilarious!The great thing about this movie is that it doesn\'t settle for outlandish set-ups that only seem to be jokes. This movie gets full bang for its comedic buck. Do we have a fight with a crocodile presented in-and-of-itself as humor? No! In a lesser film, perhaps. But Ace Ventura goes the extra mile, bringing us childish schoolyard taunts (""Stop hittin\' yourself! Stop hittin yourself!"") And is it enough to have Ace chasing the villain through the jungle in a monster truck? No - he actually pulls up next to him and utters a bon mot worthy of Groucho. Also, where did that monster truck comefrom?! The sheer resolve not to explain the truck\'s presence is a sublimely satirical dig at movies that might place monster trucks in the jungle just for cheap, lazy wackiness.This movie is anything but lazy. Jim Carrey, like no actor before him, pulls out all the stops as Ace Ventura. Is he milking things? Oh sure. He\'s milking things like Paganini milked the violin, or like Michelangelo milked the Sistine Chapel. He\'s inventing a manic persona so complete and fully realized, that it transcends standard comedy and achieves something mystical and poetic and truthful. And that\'s how it keeps from being annoying.This film is too casually dismissed because it looks like a terrible movie. I was hesitant to watch it. But maybe, years and years from now, it will achieve the kind of subversive cult-film status it deserves.', 'I didn\'t think the first movie was any great shakes.Sure, it had Carrey in it, running amok and mugging and mimicking and making every rude sound a kid would learn by eighth grade.  But the story just kept getting in the way.That\'s why ""When Nature Calls"", in my opinion, is much funnier.The story of securing a sacred bat is neither too intrusive nor annoying and leaves room for gags aplenty.  And Carrey....  Well, he enters a slapstick marathon and wins the gold in every event.  I swear the man is made of rubber.Some of the jokes are pretty gross (the spitting ritual, the ""guano"" references, etc.) but why should that come as any surprise?  Most comedies gear for that kind of humor anymore and, more or less sophisticated, reach the same common denominator: body fluids is funny, dude.Still, without the fluids and functions, there are still great scenes (Ace\'s entrance in the dining hall, the monks\' reaction to his departure, his behavior at the slide show, his driving habits, his escape from a mechanical rhino) and plenty of opportunities to see Hollywood\'s most uninhibited comedian use every conceivable part of his body to make us laugh.I laughed.  His work is done.When this ""Nature"" calls, answer it.Nine stars.

All I gotta say is, ""If you didn\'t like the first one, why did you go to see the second one? Just to complain?""

The Mask had too few of the 'mask' scenes, Pet Detective was just about OK, nothing great. This movie though is better because the story flows freely(unlike P.D) and it has a lot of Jim Carey (unlike The Mask). The scene at the monastery is actually brilliantly shot and to have such OTT comedy at what otherwise seems so mystical a location, I've never seen something like that.

19,20,113845,11517.0,"['Popcorn is the word that most describes this action-comedy movie from Joseph Reuben, the man who directed other standard fare like SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, TRUE BELIEVER, THE STEPFATHER, DREAMSCAPE, and most recently, a notorious bomb called THE FORGOTTEN.So let\'s see how I can dive into this pool without hitting a hard surface. This is a ""buddy-movie"" in which two uber-American guys of very different temperaments and backgrounds share a bond that goes beyond anything they might go through. One of the two is by default a loose cannon and drives the plot with his antics. There may be some tension when a corrupt high official threatens the loose cannon. Add a sexy new co-worker into the mix (which becomes the focus of their intense, male attraction) and basically you have a story that has been of late the norm in the Hollywood popcorn machine.Now, trying to cash in (I believe, I could be wrong) on their previous outing WHITE MEN CAN\'T JUMP, Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes play not buddies from the \'hood but foster \'brothas\' (if we can believe this baby) who are closer than a cuticle is to a finger even though Snipes has to act as older brother to a rebellious and unpredictable Harrelson: and on that note, neither is miscast. Snipes does convey steel while Harrelson gives off his just-under-the-surface danger, especially when he grins at smarmy boss Robert Blake in one subway scene.Pitching in for the Latina female is Jennifer Lopez who, without being as angry and nasal and in-your-face as Rosie Perez, actually manages to be engaging though this is early in her career, before she decided to punch out and play her (bland) self once she became the trademark known as J. Lo. She all but steals her own pat scenes, especially in one tense exchange she has with Chris Cooper playing a not-so-nice fellow who pushes people onto subway platforms, a reality among New York strap-hangers.But trying to over-analyze this film in terms of shots and composition and visual technicality would be like trying to compare one grain of popcorn to the next: there would be no difference, no relevance in taste, texture, and all that is left to do is munch down. That the action scenes on the subway platforms (for anyone who is actually acquainted with riding the subways in New York City) are as implausible as ever and only convey the type of hyper-masculinized action that makes superheroes of its actors, but who really cares? It\'s fluff, entertaining, mindless, inane, and that\'s just what people going to see this type of film expect.', 'So glad I bought this buddy money pot of a buddy cop film! Starring the delightful Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in a fun banter extravaganza and heist awesomeness! This definitely has its flaws but the pros outweigh everything. Chris Cooper is a great villain and Joseph Ruben directed a nice ballbusting experience! Also Donald Robertson (Robert Blake) was great as the jerk boss cop.', ""Reading the reviews below this seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of film. Regardless of whether you 'get' the story and the rapport between Harrelson and Snipes, you can't overlook that this is a well made film.I've only seen it twice, once when it first came out on video, and again in the past week. I didn't think it was that remarkable when it first came out, but when I watched it the second time around, I found it highly entertaining and well executed. Granted, it's not the best film ever but I don't think it's deserving of a lot of the bad reviews given here.As a film it succeeds, and if you've never seen it before, it's worth checking out."", ""This is one of Wesley Snipes best (in my opinion), with great action scenes, an awesome finale and an amazing performance from Wesley Snipes!. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is really cool, plus Wesley Snipes is simply amazing in this!, and Woody Harrelson is fantastic!. Wesley and Woody had fantastic chemistry together, and i was really surprised, by how much i enjoyed the film!, plus Jennifer Lopez surprised me, by giving a very good performance!. Robert Blake is excellent as the dick, i hated him, and i thought, it had some great humor as well!, plus the ending is hilarious. You really get to see Snipe's incredible Martial art abilities, and the fight scenes are awesome!, plus one of my favorite scenes is when Snipes and Lopez have a boxing match, it was quite amusing!. Snipes and Lopez had great chemistry together, and it's very well made as well!, plus i thought Snipe's acting was fantastic!. This is one of Wesley Snipes best (in my opinion), with great action scenes, an awesome finale, and amazing performance from Wesley Snipes!, and i say it's a must see!. The Direction is great!. Joseph Ruben does a great job! here, with excellent camera work, awesome angles,and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is fantastic!. Wesley Snipes is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious had wonderful chemistry with Woody Harrelson, kicked that ass, had loads of charisma, seemed to be enjoying himself, never really took himself seriously, and was just amazing overall! (Snipes Rules!!!!!). Woody Harrelson is fantastic here, he is extremely hilarious had wonderful chemistry with Snipes,like Snipes seemed to be enjoying himself, had a great sense of humor, and once again him and Snipes made a terrific pair! (Woody rules). Jennifer Lopez is stunningly gorgeous!, and does very well with what she had to do, i was quite surprised, she also had great chemistry with Snipes. Robert Blake is great as the prick, i hated his guts, and cheered out loud when he got punched and arrested!. Chris Cooper is extremely creepy in his role, and was quite menacing. Bill Nun is great in his cameo (Nunn Rules!). Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5"", ""After watching this movie I had one question, what was the point? The plot existed but was so thin that they had top fill it up with boring relationship scenes which served no purpose to the movie and a psycho-pyromaniac who gets his thrills from pushing people in the front of trains and burning women in ticket booths.The thin plot is that there are two brothers (whose names I can't remember) and there is the running joke that one is white and one is black, but the joke isn't funny. The white one has incurred a huge gambling debt and needs the money. They work as transit police who seem to have nothing better to do than to set up muggers in subway stations. Personally, I find it quite stupid because I don't think any police force has the resources to pretend to be drunks hoping to catch purse snatchers, and even then there is no point because the penalty is not that high.There is a train which carries all of the revenue from the ticket sales and it is dubbed the money train. This train has priority over all other trains and the controller, Paterson, is quite a mean little rat. The white guy, who owes lots of money, decides that he will steal the money train, and he does so. This is pretty silly because there was only one guard on the train with around three million dollars on it. Honestly, this movie was pretty poor and the struggle of actually building a plot is shown with the existence of a mad man. Personally, don't bother."", ""Action is an interesting film genre. You go in expecting little and are pleasantly surprised if you get more. Films like Face/Off, Die Hard, Speed, Under Siege, while formulaic, were all able to offer the viewer more than they expected going in and so have become beloved classics of the genre. The Money Train tries to be more than a lot of the action films that came out and simply disappeared in the early 90s, but falls a little short. While the film certainly isn't bad, it isn't considered a classic of the genre, and, while not a financial failure, relatively few people saw it and even fewer remember it.The film reunites the stars of White Men Can't Jump, Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as a pair of law enforcement officers John (Snipes) and Charlie (Harrelson) who basically decide to steal from their boss (Robert Blake) who is a real piece of work. John has a hot girlfriend Grace (a pre Selena Jennifer Lopez) and Charlie has a gambling problem. Sound familiar? There are some funny moments and the dramatic scenes between Snipes and Harrelson are excellent. But aside from these, there really aren't any memorable moments. While the pairing of Snipes and Harrelson isn't tired, it doesn't have the same impact it had on their previous outing. Blake is menacing and odious but his character is not a believable or effective villain. Chris Cooper, who has a smaller role in this as Torch, would have been a better antagonist.Money Train is OK and a reasonably entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but it is also a missed opportunity. Snipes, Lopez, Harrelson and Blake try hard, but the finished product is less than the sum of its parts, and that's possibly the most frustrating thing of all."", ""Two foster brothers work as transit cops. While one's life is as good as it gets, the other's is at an all time low. After losing his job, getting dumped by his brother, and getting seven bells kicked out of him by a loan shark, He implements his plan to steal the titular train. A train carrying the New York Subway's weekly revenue. But when things don't go according to plan, will his brother be able to save him in time....It was inevitable that after the success of White Men can't Jump and Bad Boys, that Hollywood re-team this pair because of the chemistry they had in that 1992 comedy.Make them cops, and you have a sure fire hit on your hands..Well you would if the main focus was on the killer The Torch, played wonderfully by Chris Cooper, rather than Harrelson trying to steal because he's gambled his life away.And this is why the film doesn't work. Harrelson is supposed to come across as a lovable rogue, but he's just a hindrance to everyone and everything, and he comes across as a complete moron.Snipes is the voice of reason, and is the reason to watch this film. He's on top form here, acting wise and action wise, and elevates the film whenever he's on screen.The film has a very nasty racist streak down it, in the form of Robert Blake's abhorrent pantomime villain. The only thing that's missing from his outfit is a white hood, the script is so blunt with it's casual racism, it ruins the flow of the film.The ending borrows from Speed, and although it's set at Christmas, it's about as festive as the hangover after new year's day.But it's not boring, Lopez makes a good supporting character, and the afterthought of The Torch sub-plot is the most interesting part of the film.If this was the primary part of the narrative, it could have been quite a good comedy thriller.Instead, the film wants you to root for a gambling loser who thinks that the world owes him something."", ""I am not a huge fan of thrillers, but once in a while there are some that surprise me. I just prefer thrillers that aren't that violent or gory and I had low expectations for ''Money Train''. Thankfully, I was wrong. While the movie is far from a must-see, it was an ok and enjoyable time-passer.The leads (played by Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes) are two foster brothers that work as transit cops. While Snipes' character has a good life, Harrelson's life is a mess. Then, as a sort of personal revenge, he decides to steal the money train (that carries the New York subway's workers' salaries). But when something goes wrong will his brother save him? See the film.The bottom line is that the movie is fun. Along with the two leads also Jennifer Lopez (in one of her first movies and one of her best) and veteran Robert Blake (few years before he retired) give nice support. The actors' performances are ok and the story is not great, but decent."", ""The movie doesn't have much of a plot but it's still a pretty entertaining movie.

20,21,113161,8012.0,"[""Barry Sonnenfeld was and maybe wasn't the right choice to make Get Shorty. He's a great visualist, and his films (Adams Family, Men in Black) are also very funny, but it's hard to say whether or not another director might've taken Elmore Leonard's sly comic novel more seriously or with less depth. As it is, however, Get Shorty is a cool little treat that doesn't over-stay its welcome, and provides its cast a plethora of witty dialog.  John Travolta brings on some sharp attitude, knowing the angles and wanting, as his character Chili Palmer, to get into Hollywood and out of loan sharking. Gene Hackman's funny as a fledgling producer with his first, true big hit in his lap.  And supporting parts from Delroy Lindo, Renne Russo, Danny De Vito (as 'Hollywood' as you'll ever see him), and James Gandolfini, are all very worthy.  It's a worthwhile watch, with a dead-on score from John Lurie.  But I would reccomend Out of Sight or Jackie Brown to Leonard fans looking for a great adaptation.  It's a very good Hollywood picture (reflective of what it's about), though it's not a masterpiece.  A-"", ""Spoilers herein.I do not expect Hollywood to ever bowl me over; I depend on other film communities for that. The Hollywood machine is so preoccupied with avoiding risk via lowbrow entertainment that we usually end up without intelligence or cleverness in our lives with them. But there are a few figures connected to that machine that I can rely on. DePalma for an intelligent eye; Ridley Scott for managing time; Soderbergh for framing and so on. But the influence of these folks rarely extends to the project as a whole.That's not the case with Danny DeVito. Forget his acting; as a director or producer you can always count on his intellect and sometimes we also get a coherent film out of the deal. In other words, we get something that conforms to the Hollywood principles (fun, exploits actors in the best way, solid production values) and at the same time has enough intellectual depth to allow some sun to shine in through cosmic windows.This film is one of those. It is not on my `must see' list, but it is one of the best Hollywood productions of the last decade.The setup is like `The Player,' a film about the writing of itself, about how life copies film and vice versa. Along the way, it subverts gangster pictures in a slightly different way than `Pulp Fiction' of the previous year - also produced (and significantly influenced) by DeVito. I really appreciate `folding' like this, and make a study of them. I already have a database of nearly a thousand examples of folding. It is a fascinating phenomenon, but rarely is it sheer fun.This one is folded and fun.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."", 'John Travolta followed up his ""Pulp Fiction"" comeback with ""Get Shorty"", in which he plays Miami hit-man Chili Palmer. Moving to Hollywood to collect a debt, he finds that show biz isn\'t much different from the mafia, and he decides to get involved. But of course, once there\'s anything mafia-related involved, things start to get ugly. Not that they weren\'t already seedy.This movie has its strengths mainly in the script, but also in the strong performances from Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito. I guess that any time that someone gets a chance to show Hollywood\'s unseemly side, they take it. Of course, there\'s plenty of reasons to do so. The sequel, ""Be Cool"", wasn\'t quite as good, but still worth seeing.', 'Elmore Leonard\'s books must be loved by film screen adapters. His characters translate very well from the written page to the moving picture. ""Get Shorty"" is one of Mr. Leonard\'s best stories and it gets a very good treatment in the hands of Barry Sonnenfeld, its director, with the help of Scott Frank, who adapted it for the screen.The casting of the movie was it\'s greatest asset. John Travolta is so cool as Chilli, the mafioso who loves movies! In his scenes with Gene Hackman, he demonstrates what a good actor he is. On the surface, he appears to do nothing; he works with an economy that is very hard to imitate. Granted, after Mr. Travolta\'s amazing appearance in Pulp Fiction, this was a confirmation and validation of his talent.It was surprising, since I didn\'t remember his appearance on the movie, to watch actor James Gandolfini, prior to his recent fame. He plays a stuntman turned wise guy. Mr. Gandolfini must have gone through a great dental cosmetic transformation, unless he was made up to look very ugly, as Bear, in the film. I have greatly admired his work before his TV series, as a fine character actor, which he demonstrates here the potential he had and was not discovered until much later.Delroy Lindo is also excellent as one of the bad guys in the film. This actor, who is as great in films as in the theater, deserves much better. He is a man that always gives an honest performance. Not being a Danny DeVito fan, I must confess that he was very restrained here. He can do very good work with the right director behind him, as he shows playing the egotistical actor, Martin Weir.Also excellent, Dennis Farina. It\'s unfortunate he doesn\'t get better choices because he is always very effective in whatever he plays. In this film, he is hysterical as Ray ""Bones"" Barboni. Rene Russo, as the bit player with a heart of gold, is good. What can be said of Gene Hackman that hasn\'t already been said? His Harry Zimm is so accurate that we believe he is this sleazy Hollywood producer. Mr. Hackman is a consummate performer who keeps getting better all the time.\nIf I had enjoyed the film the first time, looking at it a second time was a revelation.', 'Smart, funny mobster comedy/satire based on the novel by Elmore Leonard. Travolta is well-cast in one of his very best roles as a slick Miami loan shark/enforcer who travels to Los Angeles to cash in a loan, but instead ends up teaming with B-movie writer/producer Hackman to fulfill his dream of being connected to the movie business. Before he can however, he must deal with bumbling mobsters, white-collar criminals, and the anxiety of trying to find the right leading man. Crackling, hilarious dialogue, well-drawn characters, and clever insight into the movie business run rampant in this snappy little comedy. Maybe not for all tastes, but well-made and a definite must for Travolta fans. ***', ""I am not sure whether I liked the movie or just John Travolta and his character Chili Palmer. I had a lot of fun watching 'Get Shorty', based on the novel by Elmore Leonard, so it doesn't really matter. The movie is about a mobster from Miami, Chili Palmer, who ends up in Los Angeles. After meeting a movie producer named Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) he gets interested in the movie business. This is the main story, but this movie is based on an Elmore Leonard story so there are a lot of sub-plots with lots of interesting characters, all with great dialogue.Besides Chili Palmer and Harry Zimm we meet Karen Flores (Rene Russo), an actress known for her screaming, Martin Weir (Danny DeVito) who is the hot actor of the moment, Ray Bones (Dennis Farina) who wants to collect some money that Chili has, Bo Catlett (Delroy Lindo) who wants money fro Harry Zimm, Bear (James Gandolfini) who was a stuntman but now is Bo's bodyguard, Leo Devoe (David Paymer) who stole the money that brought Chili to Los Angeles and Doris (Bette Midler). All characters are colorful, have great dialogue and an interesting part in the story, but all those great things are there together with Chili. For every nice moment Travolta is present.The actors play their characters very well. Again, Travolta is great and owns the movie, but especially Farina and Hackman do a great job as well. The movie is well directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (from 'The Addams Family'), knowing how to avoid boring moments. The story with its dialogue would be enough to make a nice movie out of it. Fortunately we have the actors and direction to make it even better and definitely more entertaining."", ""After hearing, I can see instantly why this is the author, Elmore Leonard's favorite movie adaptation from his writing. First of all John Travolta was a solid-standard, as Chili. If you're a Travolta fan, this is an instant classic performance for him!! He personifies East coast attitude and 'M.O'. His breeze onto the scene and in control persona are a part of this movie that would have collapsed it, had it not been an ingredient in this mix of action, sarcasm and loan-sharking gone amok. Chili is superior. Gene Hackman, is an attempted to be cool, b-movie director, who hasn't had a hit in years, and you can feel it. Gene's man Harry is so played-right it's embarrassing. I know people that are like that. I was laughing till it hurt, from the familiar pain, of the ones who reminded me of the great Harry Zimm. Hackman is astounding.Before there was the Sopranos there was {James Gandolfini as} 'Bear' Bo's handy-man, his fix-it guy all around. Bear reminds me (sort of) one of my cousins. Ha, take that home with ya in a doggy bag!Danny Devito, is a great self-conscious (and to others feelings) selfish and unconscious, totally absorbed actor, who is about the way it is with many of the actor types, who let it go too far. Danny is the man!Rene Russo is the lovely, Karen Flores of course and she is as pretty in pictures as in 'Real' life. I got to meet her in 1992, and got a really great hug from her, she's very thoughtful and talented, with much more talent to follow after this great film.The way the story was set up and progressed with, makes me love this and puts it in a special place in my entertainment library. This is a fun 'You gotta see it and experience the mood and all the other emotions that follow' type of movie madness that makes watching some movies, very worthwhile. This is a high rater!!! (*****) Caution: Language rating pretty bad!!"", 'Anything involving something by Elmore Leonard is generally very good, in and of itself. But when coupled with performances like those of John Travolta and Gene Hackman in this picture, the result is a superb piece of entertainment.Danny De Vito, Dennis Farina and Rene Russo all deliver outstanding performances - but all pretty much convey the types of personas, on-screen, which you\'d expect from seeing their other work.However, of all actors today - young or older, new or veteran -- there are no two who are more convincing, in everything they do, than Travolta and Hackman. Serious or funny, crafty or clueless, hero or villain - - each has been completely convincing in every role, and seeing them together, one would like to see them teamed again.In this movie, both are funny, and both have their roles ""nailed:"" Travolta as the confident tough guy, completely in control; and Hackman as the ""B"" flick producer, operating on the fringe of the Hollywood scene and life in general.As much as I liked this movie, I first saw it in a St. Louis hotel suite, where we selected it from the PPV menu. I was ""fried"" from a day-long business meeting, and fell asleep early into it. The next day, my wife insisted that I catch it (she\'s one of those people who has perhaps only wanted to watch one or two other movies a second time, ever), and I was glad she did. It\'s an outstanding film, and one which entertains thoroughly from the outset to conclusion, with not a single lapse between.', 'I saw this movie in 1995 when first released, but never got around to thinking about a review until I saw it again a few weeks back on late night TV. I\'d forgotten just how good it is...From a novel by Elmore Leonard, this story is arguably the best satire about the Hollywood dream factory yet done, for two reasons: it savagely exposes and lampoons the behaviors of actors, writers, producers and directors and it implicitly compares that business with the business of small time hoodlums and loan sharks. So many times during this story does Chili Palmer (John Travolta) announce, in a bemused fashion: ""I can\'t believe how youse guys do business out here..."" Chili, as we learn very early, is a loan shark from Miami who is ordered by Bones (Dennis Farina), his new boss, to recover a $15,000 debt from Leo (David Paymer), a loser with a garrulous wife, Fay (Linda Hart) who\'s helped Leo fake his own death on a plane crash and collect $300,000 as a settlement from the airline. Fay, of course, can\'t keep her mouth shut and tells Chili that Leo scammed the money and was now living it up in Vegas. Chili, in Vegas, finds out that Leo has gone to LA. But Chili also makes a score: a Vegas casino owner asks him to lean on an LA movie producer, Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) for $150,000 still owing.So, off to La-La Land goes Chili, and that\'s where the fun really starts...The plot then changes direction, almost completely: Chili, after recovering most of the $300,000 from Leo (and letting him off lightly), gets involved with Harry in two ways \x96 first, convinces him to take on Chili\'s own idea for a movie production and second, fend off two ""investors"" (who just happened to be drug pushers also) who want their money back from Harry who \x96 you guessed it \x96 is late in getting some other movie off the ground, and has spent all their money.However, those two pushy investors, Bo Catlett and Ronnie Wingate (Delroy Lindo and John Gries), have another problem: the $500,000 drug money that they can\'t retrieve from a locker box at LAX and which Chili sees as an opportunity to make more profit. That idea, however, is blown away when Bones \x96 who would like nothing better than to see Chili dead -- arrives from Miami looking to muscle in on Chili\'s business in LA.How all that threads together into a gloriously comedic and ironic slice of Hollywood life and death is a testament to Leonard\'s brilliant story, a great screenplay and cinematography and tight editing \x96 not to mention the almost flawless acting by actors who are continually taking the mickey out of the whole business, right up to the final scene.There\'s no doubt that this is Travolta\'s comeback movie. The guy just oozes dangerous cool and --- ooops \x96 chilling competence as he maneuvers between the high and low life of a strange town, with some very strange people and even stranger business practices. But, kudos also go to Dennis Farina, Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito as the klutzes they portray; and Renee Russo is suitably decorous as Chili\'s love interest. Watch out for cameos from Bette Midler, Harvey Keitel and other Hollywood luminaries.And, here\'s the supreme self-referential irony: there really is a real Chili Palmer in the movie; he\'s one of the actors who has a bit part as one of Bones\' buddies! What a gag...Finally, note the title: Get Shorty. That\'s Elmore Leonard\'s delicious swipe at the whole gangster genre. Remember Get Carter (1971)...? Ho-ho-HO-ho-ho! Highly recommended.']"

But soon the copycat killer Peter Foley (William McNamara) contacts and stalks Helen and M.J. and Reuben give protection to her. Will they be capable to stop Foley before the next murder?""Copycat"" is an effective thriller from the 90\'s and certainly among the best ones. The performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are great and Holly Hunter is a great surprise as a detective in a thriller. There are many movies about serial-killers and the great difference in ""Copycat"" is two women in the lead roles. The identity of the killer is disclosed too soon and could be kept as a mystery; but anyway the character is not connected to Helen, Andy, M.J. or Reuben and it would not be possible to have a twist or a major surprise if the mystery was kept. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Copycat - A Vida Imita a Morte"" (""Copycat – The Life Imitates The Death"")', 'The serial killer genre is one that became popular after ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and since then the only ones that have really stuck out are ""Se7en,"" ""Copycat"" and ""Saw."" ""Copycat"" is about a psychologist who lectures students on serial killers, and one day finds herself to be a victim at one of her speeches. Attacked in the bathroom, she narrowly escapes death and becomes a social recluse in the years that follow -- living through the Internet, anonymously chatting on Internet chat rooms and so on and so forth.Until the terror begins again, this time involving not only the ex-pschologist (Sigourney Weaver) but also a cop played by Holly Hunter.""Copycat"" was much better than I thought it would be. I originally saw it on TBS years ago; I remember the ads claiming it would be on, but for some reason the rights fell through and it didn\'t air for another month or so... through this time period I hadn\'t heard anything about the film, but within the very first few minutes I instantly knew it was going to be much better than the standard ""Silence"" rip-off.I may be alone here (and trust me, I know it) but I enjoy this more than ""Silence of the Lambs,"" which kind of bores me at times. ""Copycat"" is dark and unexpectedly intelligent -- it is also perfectly cast. Weaver is fine (if unexceptional) whereas Hunter\'s macho-female traits are put into play perfectly by her casting as a cop.The killer in the movie is played by Harry Connick Jr., and even he does a good job, which is saying quite a lot.The movie has unexpected twists and is very clever in its own right. It is undoubtedly influenced (heavily) by ""Silence of the Lambs"" but is successful in the way it adds its own qualities to the mix -- much like ""Se7en"" this is a serial killer movie cashing in on the success of ""Silence,"" but not necessarily stealing its content.Very surprised. Catch it if you can.', 'Contrary to what several users have written, ""Copycat"" is _not_ ""Silence of the Lambs 2"". Nor is it a rip-off of ""Se7en"", or an exploitation flick, or any other negative labels that have been foisted upon it. Rather, it\'s a gripping, and largely intriguing thriller that succeeds thanks to performances by two confident female leads, competent direction, intelligent writing, and an appropriately foreboding score courtesy of Christopher Young, who\'s fast becoming one of my favorite film composers.Sigourney Weaver hits the right notes as the agoraphobic psychiatrist, especially early on, as we see the depths to which she has shut herself off from the outside world, creating her own safe little corner. Holly Hunter, in a role that instantly brings to mind Jane Craig from ""Broadcast News"", is effective as the investigating detective. Hers is a performance that is three-dimensional and fully-realized.If there\'s a weakness in the film, it\'s the ongoing beef between Ruben and Nico. It\'s a meritless p***ing contest stemming from one character\'s jealousy, and could\'ve easily been dropped or retooled. This small gripe, however, didn\'t deter my enjoyment of the film.Much credit has to be given to director Jon Amiel (""Sommersby"", ""Entrapment"") for effectively capturing the atmosphere and tension prevalent throughout the film. In addition, writers Ann Biderman and David Madsen deserve credit for a intelligent, well-researched screenplay. No clichés here, just sharply-crafted dialogue. And Christopher Young\'s inspired score is brilliant; just listen to the theme that plays early on, as Helen calms down after a panic attack.""Copyat"" may not be classic material, but it\'s a strong entry in a genre that\'s too often consumed by formulas and gore. Highly recommended.', 'Definitely a film that will have you on the edge of your seat, if not hugging it as closely as possible.  Copycat tells the story of a serial killer psychologist(wonderfully played by Sigourney Weaver), slowly working her way from phobias due to an attack from a serial killer, working with the law(serviceably played by a cute Holly Hunter) in search of a serial killer that kills in the previous styles of former serial killers.  The murderer uses old photos and the books of Weaver to recapture the ""essence"" of each brutal killing.  Murders are done ala Albert DeSalvo, Son of Sam, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and others.  The film is very fascinating and yet very twisted too.  The killer is played with such conviction by William McNamara. Another killer in prison(the one that attacked Weaver) is played with unusual repulsivenes by Harry Connick Jr.  The real star here is the script which has unusual intelligence for such subject matter.  There is a good deal of violence, yet a subtle humour pervades much of the discussion between the cops and even Weaver and Hunter in a few scenes.  But the thrill aspect of the film...the raw suspense...steers the picture from beginning to end.  Hunter and Weaver(particularly) do incredible jobs in their roles, and I was impressed with the film as a whole.', '""Copycat"" is a surprising good serial-killer thriller, that perhaps is not the most original movie around but its definitely one of the better executed ones.The movie is well written, with a solid story, main characters and a couple of nice twists. At the beginning you don\'t really know what the movie is going about and everything is build up in a good, non-forced or overdone way. In the beginning its still a mystery who\'s behind the killings and it even is subtly implied that the killers could be one of the cops, or one of the other characters in the movie. The movie however takes a twist when it fully shows the killer, his preparations and his actions. The movie is at times told completely from the killers point of view. This works surprisingly effective and it doesn\'t ruin the tension or mystery of the movie, in any way.What makes the movie effective and also in a way distinctive is that the main characters of the movie are two female characters. They are being portrayed by about the two strongest female leading Hollywood ladies of the moment; Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. They are two strong and independently, different from each other characters that know to carry the movie. The movie also has an excellent supporting cast with Harry Connick Jr. in a disturbing role, Will Patton and the fairly unknown William McNamara as the killer of the movie. The fact that he isn\'t as well known as an actor perhaps makes his character work out all the better.I have yet to see a Jon Amiel movie that is original on its own. His movies always heavily \'borrow\' from other movies in the same genre. He\'s a real \'copycat\' himself you may say. ""Copycat"" is really no exception to this but it this case it didn\'t bothered me since the execution of it all was superb and effective.The movie is basically good and tense from start till finish, due to a good pace, interesting well written and developed characters and a good overall build up. The movie perhaps at the end turns into a bit of a formulaic and simple one but it doesn\'t really downgrade the movie in any way. It all makes this movie one of the better genre movies of the last couple of years. The movie has basically everything in it that is needed to make a good thriller.The movie is good looking with an overall nice visual style, some nice cinematography, nimble editing and a suiting musical score from composer Christopher Young.A simply great genre movie, that deserves some more recognition and that holds up surprising well against other classic genre examples such as ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"". 8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/', ""Psychologist Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is giving a guest lecture on serial killers.

It does add a couple of interesting wrinkles and with solid female leads. Hunter is confident and fully realized. Weaver and her point of view deliver a sincere and fragile personality. The movie opens with the memorable bathroom attack. The other memorable aspect is Weaver struggling in her home. The investigation and the serial killer are less compelling. This follows the formula and it does it pretty well."", ""What happens when a serial killer expert has to face off with the real thing? That's what happens when Dr. Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver, Alien) is cornered and attacked by a man she profiled, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jr.).For the next 18 months, Dr. Hudson is a recluse, refusing to leave her computer and high rent apartment, only allowing her friend Andy into her world. A new series of murders - right in her neighborhood - threaten to draw her out. Joining up with Inspector Monahan (Holly Hunter) and Rueben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney), she begins to realize that this killer is copying the world's worst serial killers.It also turns out that the killer is following the script she presented on the night that Cullum attacked her. Along the way, Rueben is killed in a police standoff and Monahan has to deal with her feelings of loss.After her friend Andy is killed like Jeffrey Dahmer, they figure out that the killer is Peter Foley. As the police get to his house, they realize that it was a ruse and he's kidnapped Helen, placing her back into the same crime scene she was in 18 months before. Will Monahan be able to save her friend? Will Dr. Hudson be able to deal with her crippled agoraphobia?This is a fine 90's crime drama, with Connick quite good in his role. Weaver has stated that of all her films, she was most proud of Copycat, as she worked hard to understand how an agoraphobic would behave and she's regretted that the movie is not better remembered."", ""Dr Helen Hudson is an expert in serial killers and lectured on the subject until one day she nearly became a victim herself. Thirteen months later and she is agoraphobic; never leaving her home in San Francisco. Now another serial killer is operating in the city and M.J. Monahan and her partner Reuben Goetz are leading the investigation to catch him. Hudson contacts the police anonymously because she believes the killer is imitating the crimes of the Boston Strangler. Monahan quickly figures out who contacted them and soon Hudson is pulled, somewhat unwillingly, into the investigation. The killer sends a video clip to Hudson which she believes is his next victim; sure enough there is another murder but the MO is completely different. This should indicate a different killer as serial killers don't change their methods but something is different here; the killer has just copied a different killer, or in this case pair of killers. The killings continue, with other killers being copied until ultimately Hudson is targeted in a recreation of the previous attempt on her life.After 'The Silence of the Lambs' serial killer films were the flavour of the moment. This is a solid enough example of the genre; not one of the best but certainly not one of the worst. The story gets off to a good start and having a main killer who copies others was interesting. Unfortunately the sense of mystery is somewhat reduced as we are shown the killer fairly early on; once we've seen his face it is just a question of who he will copy him next and how the cops will ultimately stop him. Apart from Monahan the police are depicted as fairly incompetent; the officer posted outside Hudson's door is easily lured away and another leaves his gun in an unlocked drawer near a suspect with tragic consequences. Solid lead performances from Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter raise the quality of the production from something fairly routine to make it well worth watching if you are a fan of the genre."", ""This is an overlooked, intelligent, frightening thriller.   It poses a sick, shrewd serial killer against a brilliant psychologist/writer/professor (Weaver) and an attractive team of cops. Weaver delivers an outstanding performance as the brilliant agorophobic (sp.?) who has been emotionally devastated by a prior run-in with a serial killer. Offers a clif's notes review of the century's major serial killers, constant tension, crisp writing and outstanding performances.  In short, it is a very good, very scary movie, and you should see it it you haven't yet.   Personally, I also think Weaver looks fabulous.  Brains and beauty and character.  Nice combination.""]"
22,23,112401,9691.0,"['Assassins is a top notch, big budget thriller that is often over looked when discussing Stallone\'s filmography. Which is a shame, cause it\'s one of Sly\'s better films and his performance as an aging burn out hit-man is quite solid.Antonio Banderas really steals the show though as the over the top and cocky newcomer who idolizes Stallone\'s character. Banderas is full of energy and his performance is electric. Miguel Bain is one of Banderas\' best roles. An all time great movie villain perhaps.Many fans forget about Stallone\'s solid output in the 90\'s, Cliffhanger is always mentioned but Assassins seems to be forgotten. It\'s a slick and explosive action thriller from ""Lethal Weapon"" director Donner. Featuring some great dialog and shoot outs between Stallone and Banderas.On the negative side, the film is too long. Running over 2 hours, ""Assassins"" begins to wear out it\'s welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously.Like ""Daylight"" and ""Copland"", ""Assassins"" is one of Stallone\'s most underrated films from the 90\'s. An over looked gem that deserves to be seen again.', ""This movie is very entertaining and has appropriate amount of action and suspense. The action sequences are great and the interactions between Stallone and Banderas excellent. If you're a fan of action films, this one is definitely worth a watch."", ""This highly engaging thriller has a polished edge of style and sophistication to it, giving it an upper hand over the rest of the endless action movies churned out during the never-ending '90s. Mixing the talents of an established director who knows how to handle the action - step up, Richard Donner - and two soon-to-be-mega-famous scriptwriters, the Wachowski brothers (THE MATRIX), plus some surprisingly good performances from the interesting cast, and what you have is a decent movie. The action sequences are excellently handled, highly realistic and at the same time very exciting, and the various special effects and stunts are inserted perfectly into the flow of things.Meanwhile the scenes of suspense between the action are full of very real danger, so despite the long running time you never find your attention wavering. Cast in the flawed hero mould is endlessly-criticised Sylvestor Stallone, putting in a nicely subtle performance and letting his nemesis, Antonio Banderas, do all of the (over)acting as psychotic but deadly assassin Miguel Bain. Holding the movie together is a low-key and sweet Julianne Moore, as a surveillance expert who finds herself over her head and in the middle of a violent battle to the death between two expert marksmen. The only problem I have with a film like this is that all other action movies don't possess the same level of commitment, grace, and intelligence as this one does."", ""This is one of Stallone's best films and I feel like people never talk about it. Him and Antonio Banderas star as hitmen vying for the same target when Stallone switches for a sassy Julianne Moore. The two juggernauts keep coming for eachother.

There are more holes in this story than swiss cheese, as the cliché somewhat goes.Having said that, however, I did enjoy the action scenes and the by-play between the two assassins - ""Robert Rath"" (Sylvester Stallone) and ""Miguel Bain"" (Antonio Banderas) - enough to make it a fun ride. I might even have rated it another star higher had a few things weren\'t confusing and left unanswered, or Banderas spoke clearer English. Still, it\'s not bad and for fans of ""Sly"" and action films, worth a look.', ""Professional hit-man Robert Rath wants to fulfill a few more contracts before retiring but unscrupulous ambitious newcomer hit-man Miguel Bain keeps killing Rath's targets.How often are Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas in the same movie? Not very often. And how often are they both killers, who would be more than happy to kill each other? Only once, so far as I know. It is a great combination, and proof that Stallone was not just a star of the 80s -- he is just as strong here (and some would say he is still good in 2015).This also happens to be one of those Julianne Moore films that has her as a main character before you realized that Moore was a big star. Maybe at this point it was more obvious, but it is quite surprising how many films she did before she was seen as an A-list actress."", ""Assassin Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) arrives at a funeral to kill a prominent mobster, only to witness rival hired gun Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas) complete the job for him. Rath decides to take one last job and then return to civilian life but that final contract sees him falling for his target(Julianne Moore) and then becoming a marked man himself.Not one of my favourite Stallone films, its a bit lame actually and that's taking into account its age too. There were just too many dumb things to let go -the gun hidden in the cast at the funeral (like that's not obvious) Stallone's magic sandwich that he keeps taking bites out of but never chews or swallows, hiding behind a gravestone in plain sight of the mobs of Day of the Dead people that somehow don't see them. Maybe I just took this too seriously? I enjoyed it more as it moved along, I guess because the action picks up. Stallone does a decent enough job and I suppose he's meant to be some kind of anti-hero but that aspect never really comes through. A young Julianne Moore plays Electra, who is a high tech hacker/crazy cat lady/voyeur. Weird.As for Antonio Banderas he's c-c-crazy but in a good way. Totally over the top and insane, fun to watch cat and mouse-ing his way after Stallone. The ending climax is decent especially the bank scene with Antonio waiting (all day) to take Rath out and then the show down in the crumbling building. 2/17/16"", 'I had never been a huge fan of Sylvester Stallone in the 1980s. I find most of his 80s flicks unwatchable. He doesn\'t have that ability to let loose and make fun of himself while still entertaining like Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger. I can think of a dozen or so Arnie flicks from his career that I can just plain sit back and enjoy b/c Arnie knew how to entertain an audience. Stallone has always taken himself too seriously and been too stiff. But guess what? A funny thing happened in the early 1990s. I started to like Sylvester Stallone! All of a sudden, he made these hugely entertaining action flicks that his style of, errr, acting seemed to be suited for: CLIFFHANGER, THE SPECIALIST, DAYLIGHT, and this film, my favorite of the lot, ASSASSINS. I love ASSASSINS! I can watch it over and over. The tone, pace, and style of the film perfectly fits Stallone\'s stoic, glaring, steely demeanor. And Stallone is damn freakin good in this film! It\'s one of his better film performances. Stallone plays Robert Rath (cool name), a veteran highly paid assassin who will only assassinate high-level shady criminals (nicknamed ""marks""). He has morals of course, as noted early in the film. But Rath wants out. He\'s tired of killing for a living, so he wants to do one last job, assassinating a reclusive billionaire ""mark"" named Alan Branch, who financed South American death squads.But there\'s a complication. Rath finds that he\'s no longer alone. A cocksure, boisterous young gun named Miguel Bain (played with vim, vigor, and verve by Antonio Banderas). Bain kills Branch at his brother\'s funeral (where Rath was going to kill him), then the fun begins! Rath tracks down Bain and tries to eliminate him, but to no avail. Bain escapes and so Rath wants to know from his secret employer who this kid is. So Rath agrees to do one last job (this time he\'s serious; it pays 2 million dollars) to retrieve a disc with encrypted information and kill the buyers and the seller (""the mark""). The buyers are Interpol agents trying to capture Rath and Bain\'s secret employer. The ""mark"" (who intercepted the transmission) is a hot, slightly skewered-in-the-brain redheaded genius named ""Elektra"" and she is played by then newcomer and now top Hollywood actress Julianne Moore. I\'ve never seen Moore\'s big time Oscar-nominated movies (except BOOGIE NIGHTS), but I\'ve seen her in a lot of other stuff and this is my favorite thing she\'s done.As Rath is about to complete this \'final\' mission, Bain steps in again and kills the buyers while Rath gets to Electra first before she turns over the disk information, but decides not to kill her since Bain has interceded again and he wants to stop this kid and deal with his employer for hiring him by extorting for 20 million dollars for his trouble. It is during this time that Rath and Electra develop a connection and become partners to stop Bain from repeating history (Rath killed the #1 assassin 15 years before to be #1; now Bain wants to kill Rath so he can become #1). Stallone, Banderas, and Moore are all excellent and keep the action lively and moving. I like the way the film shows how these highly trained professionals plot, scheme, think, and outwit their way through sticky and tricky situations. The action is spare, yet exciting when it comes and the film is an very interesting character study. It never slows down or drags at all, even though the pace is delibarate. The final showdown is thrilling to say the least. Well done all the way around!', ""Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas star in this great action-thriller.  Sylvester Stallone plays Robert Rath, who is supposed to kill this guy at a funeral, but someone beats him to it.  He tracks the man and has a nice little talk with him.  The other man is another assassin, Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas).  Rath (who is the best assassin there is) gets another assignment worth two million dollars.  Eliminate buyers and return girl and disk and he can retire.  Bain wants to beat Rath and complete the task first.  What follows is a battle between the two assassins.  Sylvester Stallone looks sleepy, at one time they show a close-up of his eyes and Julianne Moore's eyes.  You can see the difference so easily.  Banderas is alive, which is good.  The best performance is probably from Julianne Moore who is the girl they have to get the disk from.  Special effects are good, as is the ending climax.  Overall, it is thrilling, with a fair amount of action and violence.""]"
23,24,114168,12665.0,"['Powder is a beautiful story and I liked where it was set, Wizard of Oz style, in the American farm heartlands, much as so much good sci fi has been. Must be some sort of affinity there. If Powder is an example it is well deserved. Forgive me if it is in Canada. Beside the point, Lance Herikson is a highly balanced character, well played. There are other mountainous good characters as well, all played well. Great effects, a surprise. Why am I only just hearing of this masterpiece! Important sci fi and an easy 10 from me.', 'Sean Patrick Flanery, better known as Indiana Jones in the several ""Young Indiana Jones"" films, plays ""Powder"", an albino whose mother was struck by lightning right before he was born.  Mom died, dad disowned him, and Powder grew up in the basement of his grandparents\' home, learning everything into his teenage years just by reading books.  And he knew every book, down to being able to recite anything on any page!He is discovered after his one remaining grandparent dies. He is evaluated and put into a home for boys. Being unpigmented and totally hairless, everyone stares at him, and the bullies in school treat him badly. It is discovered that he has the highest I.Q. ever recorded, and when an ""educator"" asks him if he knows what that means, he replies, ""If you really believe that about me, why are you asking me that question?""  Good script writing.In a very powerful scene, after a deer is shot, Powder touches the deer and grasps the hunter, and transfers the feelings such that the hunter feels what the deer feels as it dies.  That realization totally changes the man, one of the local deputies.Another is when Powder helps the sheriff understand what his dying wife wants, which turns out only for the father and son to reconcile.Jeff Goldblum, like every movie he is in, is the ""scene stealer"" in each scene he is in.  He is such a good actor, especially when he plays a scientist, as he does here.  he realizes that Powder is something special, and closer to being ""pure energy"" than anyone before. His classroom demo of ""Jakob\'s Ladder"" goes haywire when all the electricity is attracted towards Powder, literally lifting him off the floor.  Which was a sign of things to come, during the interaction with lightning during the final scene.""Powder"" is an absorbing film, obviously fictional, but thought-provoking. I rate it a strong ""8"" of 10.This film uses the albinism and electrical energy as a vehicle to explore the concept of ""different"", and works the issue of how far humanity needs to come to respect each other, and especially embrace each others\' differences.Mary Steenburgen is cast as the social worker who first rescues Powder from the cellar, and who tries to find a way for him to live a normal life.', ""If someone explained the plot of Powder to me, I would assume it was some sappy, simple, over emotional clap trap, from someone like Spielberg.  Yet when I actually saw the film, I found it to be deep, intelligent and very moving.There are some things wrong with the film, a number of the characters are stereotypes and some parts of the plot are a little unexpected.  If you ignore these simple problems, the quality of the direction and acting shine through, to provide an excellent film.I very rarely say this, but I think, Sean Patrick Flanery's performance is one the most remarkable I have ever seen.  Tender and awkward, without looking false.Overall an excellent film, but maybe for the more mature viewer."", 'Sean Patrick Flannery is an incredibly under rated actor after this remarkable performance he gave in ""Powder"", while the story is very dark and just not pleasant, he really gave it his all into this film and you can see how emotionally connected he is in it. We also have Mary Steinberg and Jeff Goldblum who give their all into their characters, I just think they were not that well developed enough. They could have had a little more.The movie starts off with a mother and father rushing into labor, only on the way, unfortunately is struck by listening in a massive thunderstorm. She does not survive, but the baby does and the father is not only devastated but rejects his son. Sean plays Jeremy or as most people call him, ""Powder"" due to him being an albino. He is hidden in his grandparent\'s basement and has never been out of the house. When his grandmother passes, Jessica Caldwill, played by Mary Steinberg, convinces Jeremy that he must leave and they\'ll give him and home and school to attend. He does leave and slowly progresses towards what he thinks may be a better life.When Donald Ripley, a school teacher, has the I.Q. results for Jeremy for his school, he is amazed. There is no score high enough for Jeremy, he\'s smarter than Albert Einstein. He can memorize book pages word for word, he knows agonizing math problems, and knows the pain of the world. He also has a mysterious power where he if he is exposed to electricity, he gets electrocuted. He also has the power to make people feel the same pain as they inflicted unto another, he also can read minds. Unfortunately, this isn\'t making him very popular with the jocks of the school who brutally torment him not just mentally but physically. There is only really Donald, Jessica, and another girl Lidnsey who want to be his friends. Only he\'s just not willing to except this world of pain when so many people doubt and torture him like Doug Barnum who is the town\'s sheriff and just thinks Jeremy is a freak. His wife is unfortunately dying and comes to Jeremy to ask for a favor and to help him find out what his wife wants. This scene is so extremely touching and tearful. The scene that got to most to me is when the boys go on a hunting trip and the coach shoots a deer for sport and are just laughing at this poor deer dying. Jeremy then takes his hand on the deer and his other hand on the coach and the coach starts to have somewhat of a seizure, and he made the coach feel the same pain he put on the deer. Poetic justice and well deserved I thought.""Powder"", despite being depressing, is a pretty decent picture worth viewing if you are in the mood for a sappy flick. But trust me, it is worth the it, you get a great performance that deserved more praise by Sean, also the same with Mary and Jeff. The acting just takes this movie to where it should be.7/10', ""I have not seen any of Victor Salva's movies before until now. He is also the director of the recent horror film Jeepers Creepers. The actors are all quite good: Mary Steenburgen as the woman that tries to help, Lance Henriksen as the local sheriff, Jeff Goldblum as the science teacher, and especially Sean Patrick Flanery as Powder. The movie can be classified in a number of ways: uplifting drama, family picture, and horror. There are strong moments of absolute emotional power, beauty, and humanity as Powder tries to fit in amongst the local people, but ends up teaching them lessons about humanity instead. Powder's appearance seemed even Chaplin-like at times, emoting with the slightest variances in expressions like a mime. Like many uplifting family movies, Powder was hard to find. I had never heard of it before and wonder if it was ever in theaters even. I don't think the script was developed enough and it was a bit predictable at times. I would rate it a PG-13 movie because of the intensity in some scenes and innuendo in the bullying. Teenagers, who feel they don't fit in, will strongly identify with Powder and will probably love this movie. However, this is also a horror movie, but a different kind of horror movie. At first it seems to follow in Carrie's shoes, setting up a revenge plot. But the horror we see isn't a misfit student getting revenge in unspeakable ways on classmates. It's in the town's inability to treat Powder with humanity. *** of 4 stars."", 'It is rare that I see a movie as unforgettable and unpredictable as Powder. I am not a man who is easily impressed with special affects, but in this movie the affects always served a purpose instead of covering up the fact that there was no purpose. In an age where movies have become multiple scenes of graphic violence and corny excuses for stories, Powder is refreshing, filled with the meaning of humanity, and moved me to tears throughout the entire film. With most films, I am able to predict exactly what will happen and when. With Powder I could never quite tell what was going to happen next, and the ending was something I would have never imagined would happen and could only be described as extraordinary. There are so many elements to this movie: The paranormal; the challenge to everything we think we know about science and the capabilities of the human mind; the human capacity for cruelty; love and forgiveness; and the hope that our own humanity will one day advance beyond our own technology. Most of all, the raw emotion of this great masterpiece reaches deep into the heart and leaves an impression that stays with you. This is one of those rare movies that you will never forget, a true classic that illustrates truths about humanity that have existed since the beginning of time.', ""The movie 'Powder' is a return to innocence. It possesses a spiritual quality that opens the eyes to life. And it lends a soothing note to those questions for which their seems to be more questions and few answers. Sean Patrick Flannery's performance was so powerful that one could actually feel the unconditional love within the heart and soul of the character that he played. The concepts that were brought forward, the passion that came with every dramatic scene, and the sense of realism and truth made it one of the most thought provoking movies of all time. Powder was not based on a true story, but it is, I feel, everybody's true story in some way, and it is as powerful, passionate, and inspirational as any true story I have ever seen. Some viewers may wish to begrudge the apparent perfection portrayed by the lead character. However, his only perfection was the way he searched so deep, often at great personal expense, for the suppressed perfection in everyone, and the hidden perfection in everything. I was somewhat disappointed by how the family quality of the movie was spoiled by the use of language by the school bully. Still, a must see for anybody who enjoys a thought provoking film once in a while. Even if you're a person who would prefer to sit down with a good book, as am I, the movie 'Powder' is definitely worth your time. In conclusion: 'Powder' is one of my favourite movies of all time. Seconded, in my opinion, only to 'The Boondock Saints'; also starring Sean Patrick Flannery."", 'I have taken in hand the constructive criticism of others about this film. I\'ve noticed that most people don\'t like the film because of Salva\'s criminal record. That\'s no reason to give it ill-repute.The film itself is a little dodgy in parts and could have used some better acting from some of its stars. Sean Patrick Flanery does an amazing job as Jeremy Reed, and I believe he was well-suited for the part.\nI didn\'t like Lance Henriksen\'s acting at all. I thought that the way he portrayed the character was a little too repetitive and boring. But then again, I don\'t care for him as an actor anyway. I think he\'s crotchety, annoying, and outdated; and the characters he chooses to play reminds me of the acclaim that Robert Redford always gets - undeserved.The film is about a young man who suffers a birth ""defect"" after his pregnant mother is struck by lightning and killed. OK, I can understand some of this. He is raised by grandparents who soon begin to fear him and show him no emotion - not unlike his father. When his last grandparent dies he is left alone for a short period of time before he is discovered by the police. Our main character is highly intelligent, scared, telekinetic, and has an electric personality, not to mention he\'s an albino, too.A social worker, Jessica, played by Mary Steenburgen is called to take over the boy\'s case and he is placed in a group living situation in a home. He is placed with delinquents and abandoned children who have no respect for him. I love Steenburgen and think she always does a good part in any film she is in. She\'s a fine actress, and though she may not be classed as ""dazzlingly"" beautiful, her charms show through no matter what character she plays. She\'s heart-warming, endearing, and always brings a good sense of love to a film.Those who say that Salva\'s sexual undertones are present in the film can be dismissed right away. I knew nothing of Salva\'s past when I watched this film for the first time, and I noticed nothing out of the ordinary. Goldblum\'s character, who is a science teacher and befriends the boy, does a good job of interacting with him. He\'s not molesting him or harming him by holding his hand and giving him a long-needed hug. If you\'re assuming this shows sexual predators at work, I think you need to see the therapist, not Salva.Also, the scene in which he is looking at another boy who is in the locker room is not about lust. He is longing to be able to do normal things that others do without being ridiculed. If you\'ll remember, it\'s the very next scene where they tell him he\'s a freak who is as ""bald as a baby."" He just wants to fit in, and it is at this point that I believe he realizes he doesn\'t.Overall, this film does bring a sense of wonder to the viewer. If you sit back and take it all in, Salva is showing us what might happen if we all stop judging one another and start accepting human beings for their uniqueness. He\'s not trying to make you accept him for being a child predator. He\'s showing the world that people are ALL different, and if we spent a little less time being so blocked and full of hate, we might come to realize this and appreciate the aesthetic value of the human soul.I gave this film a 7 out of 10 because I didn\'t like Lance Henriksen\'s performance at all, I thought some of the characters could have come through in the end (Why didn\'t his love interest stand up for herself against her father? Why were there loose strings here?), and I would have liked to have seen more ""after the fact"" wrap-ups when Jeremy becomes raw energy in the film\'s climax. Also, why in God\'s name does Powder have eyelashes if he is unable to grow hair? Huh? What? OK, so Sean does have pretty eyes, but, come on!On a side note, for those of you who think that the Deputy Sheriff\'s character was a ""stereotypical"" cop character, giving the police a bad name...I have relatives who are police in a small town like this one, and you should hear THEM talk over the dinner table. It ISN\'T much different.', 'A story that encapsulates where we as a race are heading for a very bad outcome indeed. As clearly stated in the film by Jeff Goldblum\'s character, "" when technology surpasses humanity"". We as a species are in severe danger and crisis over how we perceive what our lives are truly about. We are losing our humanity by advancements in our technology that serve only to relieve us of harnessing our one true purpose that makes us unique within our humanity........Choice. The film also shows that a pure and unique individual is not accepted within those who are already lost of their own humanity. I find myself relating to \'powder\' in many ways, albeit minus his physical and other obvious electrical abilities. But I do understand his humanity and choice to make humane decisions that do affect all of us. And his feeling of isolation and not \'fitting in\' to his fellow kind. Hopefully one day we can be at a point where our humanity will rise above our technological demands, otherwise we are on a roller-coaster ride to self destruction. Good film,good message.']"
24,25,113627,451.0,"[""Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?"", 'If Mike Figgis never made another film, and Nick Cage and Elizabeth Shue retired after making Leaving Las Vegas, they would have done so with impunity. Both actors are superb, and bring the excellent screenplay to life with the help of some masterful dramatic cinematography.Cage plays a suicidal alcoholic who has come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death, and Shue plays the unexpected problem - a prostitute who falls in love with him. The only reason this film did not receive a ten from me is the voice-over technique which was tastefully minimal, but, in my opinion, the only mistake the director made. It does help to provide closure, but I felt that closure was an unnecessary compromise here.This is not an entertaining film, and in truth, I am surprised by its popularity among typical audiences. It is a serious film, and a work of art, but fun is not to be found here. DO NOT see this film if you dislike feeling emotionally drained and ethically challenged, and DO NOT see it if you are very prone to boredom, or easily offended by sexual violence, substance abuse and the horror of daily life on the street. This is an intensely sad film about love shared by people who are caught in the gravity of their lives and can not escape. It is also a story of redemption and respect, found in improbable places. It is NOT a fun-filled frolicking romantic comedy, but rather, the opposite, and it achieves a beauty, dignity and power almost unique among films treating such starkly real and disturbing subjects.', 'Remarkable. Touching. Riveting. Leaving Las Vegas is all of these and then some. I have not seen a film of this magnitude about loneliness and acceptance in such a while that I was in tears for much of the run time.Nicholas Cage is Ben, a man who has lost his wife and child, throws his job away, and takes all of his remaining money to buy as much liquor as possible and ""drink himself to death"" in the city of Las Vegas. He has given up all hope, with no wish to live, but for one reason or another, wants a companion to share in his misery, but not try to save him. He finds this companion in a hooker, Sera, played by Elizabeth Shue. They immediately form a strong relationship based on one night of talking about their lives. Sera in particular quickly grows attached to Ben, for no other reason than she has been alone her whole life and wants nothing more than to feel that want and need by someone.Cage won his first Oscar for his role as Ben, and how deserved it was. He was astounding, perfection, down to every single tick, the volume of his voice, the pain and tragedy buried in his eyes. I could not believe the extent of his role, the dedication and time he invested in bringing this character to life. Same goes for Elizabeth Shue, who with a simple glance at a person, she reveals her entire self, and no one even dares to notice except for Ben. This neediness is apparent, she wants to hold onto this relationship so badly, yet what makes their relationship work is total and complete acceptance of their respective decisions. He will not tell her to stop being a hooker, and she in return can never ask him to stop drinking. And it is in that factor that makes this film worth watching. To be totally accepted by those around them, to open themselves up to such an extreme.Leaving Las Vegas is a sobering film about connections, loneliness, acceptance, and a small little island of hope that is Ben and Sera. They are two good people, depicted in a world full of sorrows and misdeeds, who latch onto each other and never let go. They were nothing but ghosts, till that chance encounter, and became each others worlds. Cage and Shue bring these good people to life in such an extraordinary way, making Leaving Las Vegas a film to be treasured and remembered for years to come. I highly recommend this film.', 'Mike Figgis directed beautifully \'Leaving Las Vegas\'... His film resulted audacious, fiercely realistic... Hollywood had great success with movies about alcoholism: ""The Lost Weekend"" which won four Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Ray Milland and ""Days of Wine and Roses,"" depicting Jack Lemmon as a charming drunk who loses his job because of this, and brings his wife (Lee Remick) down with him...In \'Leaving Las Vegas,\' Figgis captures the chaos inside an alcoholic divorcée... He shows the complexity of life and human relationships... He invites us to use our imaginations about a suicidal alcoholic... He never really explained how his character is bent on killing himself, nevertheless his powerful message remains a very sad one, extremely difficult to embrace... The final scene in a dark, filthy motel room rank as some of the most heartbreaking moments I have ever seen in film, and surely it will leave you terribly moved... Figgis treats his two leading characters tenderly... He never makes moral pronouncements, and to his credit, the film remains honest to the end, never sinking into sentimentality...His style as his story remembers me Marco Ferreri\'s greatest international success, \'La Grande Bouffe\' (Blow-Out), a black and highly flatulent comedy (that won the Grand Jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973) about four middle-aged men who gather in a well-appointed villa to eat themselves to death...\'Leaving Las Vegas\' is the depressing love story of a failed drunken writer and a self-assured $500-a-night young hooker with whom he crosses paths... It is an appeasing tale of a dedicated drunk who downs entire bottles of hard liquor in several gulps... He is on the way down and he recognizes it... He is an ecumenical drinker who wants to destroy everything that remains of his old life... He fills his supermarket jumbo cart with as much booze as possible, and moves for Vegas to literally drink himself to death... Nicolas Cage is remarkable as Ben Sanderson, the alcoholic who is resolute and actually thoughtful about his self-destruction..Ben admits he has nothing to live for and he wants to die... He swills vodka from the bottle in the shower... He drinks greedily at the bottom of a swimming pool... He drinks, and drinks, \'til there\'s no more... And when he discovers that the Casino does not offer the Bloody Mary\'s that he asks, he explodes, overturning the table of Blackjack where he was gambling... He wakes up at night shaking so much he can merely crawl to the refrigerator and intensely swallows Vodka mixed with a little orange juice... Elisabeth Shue proves to be a revelation as Sera.. A polite, beautiful, and sensitive blonde woman who prides herself on being just a high-class call girl... Nevertheless her vulnerable character is very puzzling for her terrible lifestyle, and her strange desperate attachment to a sadistic pimp Yuri Butso... Sera meets Ben and inexplicably finds herself attracted to him... She soon develop a rich closeness that can nearly be described as love... Ben continues to tell her that true love between them could never happen... After Yuri is soon out of the way by Russian thugs, she takes Ben under her wing, and attempts to fill a need in her life much like Ben fills his needs with liquor... Both share a common bond of misery and loneliness... Sera cares for Ben enough to handle his drunken bouts of coldness... She complies to Ben\'s own terms and vows to never dissuade him from his suicidal goal... Out of sheer love, she even buys him a silver flask for a present, while, inside, she is desperate to find some way to change his course as well as her own... In one of the most revealing scenes at a desert resort, she drowns herself in sunlight and liquor to seduce Ben... She tries to love him, and in his infrequent getaways of semi-sobriety, he attempts to love her back... The opportunity is shattered as Ben, without an ability or desire to change, becomes for her a tragic portrait of life without hope... How foolish of her to push him to select...Shue keeps, all the way, an intriguing character extremely human... She is good and tender... Never tough or cynical... Her observations, without dialog, suggest just a sliver of expectation... In the final outcome, this dream hooker is the heart of the story... The Academy showed their appreciation by giving her a best actress nomination...""Leaving Las Vegas"" is pain, isolation and honesty... An unusual picture of human desperation and impotency... A study of acceptance, resignation and despair of an amazing two characters... An examination of what happens when two lovers are caught in cycles of self-destruction... The film is extremely well written, directed and acted... The chemistry between Cage and Shue is sizzling... They are able to solve their existential frustrations by connecting in perfect harmony, and yet they are still completely alone... \'Leaving Las Vegas\' has some film noir feel by moments, specially during the dark alleyways and hookers, where its neon signs are seedy, its nights perpetual, and the glitter absent... Figgis\' camera moves as fluidly as the alcohol guzzles bottle after bottle down Cage\'s throat... The music adds plenty to the motion picture with ballads playing a large role in the odd romance... Like Chaplin and Woody Allen, Figgis molds his movie by using his own music...In an ironic twist of events, the book\'s author John O\'Brien actually committed suicide in 1994, two weeks after selling the movie rights... He never got to see his vision realized on the screen... Director, Mike Figgis finished the film as a tribute...', ""Ben Sanderson is an alcoholic, who after getting released from his well paid screen writing position, heads to Vegas with his severance pay. Where he seriously plans to drink himself to death. But whilst cruising down the strip he meets Sera, a nicely turned out prostitute, and both troubled souls come together in an unlikely romance. Based around the semi-autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, an alcoholic who committed suicide before the film made it to the screen, this is a sad, dark and deeply upsetting picture. Sanderson and his plight has no motive, we are not fed reasons for his nihilistic behaviour. We find him at the beginning of the film joyously hurtling thru a liquor market isle, promptly filling his shopping cart with bottles of liquor. From here on in we know that this is no ordinary film about an alcoholic trying to get off the booze, we are on a train to Bleakville, stops at Love and Liberation seem a very long way away. Enter Sera, the sweet and wholesome prostitute, who having escaped the abusive and borderline psycho pimp, Yuri, is herself in need of liberation. But can she carry the burden of both as this unlikely and almost certainly doomed romance starts to become significant? Nicholas Cage as Sanderson is terrific, very compelling, realistic and segueing from zany wired comedy to the desolation of Sanderson's death wish descent within a heart beat. Elisabeth Shue as Sera is also incredibly potent, if perhaps guilty of looking too pristine, and prompting questions of why she would be drawn to Ben's world anyway? Shue none the less works her socks off to make Sera sensitive and believable. Directed by Mike Figgis, who shot it beautifully in Super 16 film, the film won a Best Actor Academy Award for Cage, and garnered nominations for Best Actress {Shue} & Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay {both Figgis}. Massively popular and praised on release, it has lost none of the impact that it had back then. 8/10"", 'To me, this is one of the best romantic films that you can get your hands on. If you are interested in seeing a pure love, one that is not focused purely on sex, but instead emotional and mental connectiveness, then this is the film for you. While others will argue that this is not the best date film, I would beg to differ. Leaving Las Vegas would be a perfect choice for a first date film over anything that Meg Ryan or the recycle bin of Hollywood has to offer. It is a gripping story of realistic love, and the dramatic consequences of giving your heart to someone. It is about dreams, companionship, and the hurdles of everyday romance. This is a film that proves that the darker underbelly of our society still has a shimmering light of hope and love. Director Mike Figgis has done an outstanding job of giving these two rich characters the right elements to build upon the ""classic"" love-story moments, while giving it a flavor uniquely his own. Figgis\' mixture of gritty Vegas with the beautiful jazz sounds really created the ambiance of love and pushed these two ugly ducklings closer towards their transformation into love. I think that is what really captured me on this film, was that it was similar to the love stories that Hollywood continually releases, except it gave us two tragic characters instead of these bubbly, money isn\'t everything, characters that seem to be repetitive cogs in the Hollywood machine.Let me explain this further. When you think of a love story, what are the elements that you consider? You have a guy and a girl (normally), they have this coincidental moment where they find their common bond, they are held back by either an internal or external dilemma, there is a factor of insecurity, and finally the dramatic ending where the two rush together at a predisclosed location (normally an airport). Does that sound familiar in any way? These are all elements that you can find in LLV. I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and for some odd reason it was this viewing that it just seemed to click for me. This is the perfect American love story told with a darker tone. While most will see this as nothing more than the story of a drunk trying to kill himself and a graphic scenes with a prostitute, I saw it as the classic story of love. All the elements are present. Ben and Sera coincidentally meet one night, both seeking companionship and without the pressures of sex, they immediately form this bond that will never be broken. Through Ben\'s drunkenness, he remembers her and continually wants to see her. They both have internal factors that hold them back, Sera\'s is prostitution while Ben\'s is his drinking. Even through there are these factors, they still find themselves together. That feeling of insecurity is even there when Sera arrives home one night to find Ben with someone else. It all seems to fit. Then there is the amazing ending that will either have you in rapture or in awe. These two are in love, and it isn\'t this bubbly love between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, it is truths of America finding the dream of compassion.The only unnecessary moments that I felt could have been fine-tuned were those involving Julian Sans. I just couldn\'t capture his character. I needed a bit more back-story or perhaps more interactions between him and Sera. Something was missing that distracted from the scenes that they shared. Outside of this one element, the rest of the film was purely flawless and even at times carnal. For example, when Sera has the opportunity to be on her own, she chooses to forgo her independence and be with Ben. Shue and Figgis both demonstrate that perhaps Sera is not in love with Ben, but instead the concept of a man wanting to be with her because of who she is. It is obvious that Sera seeks companionship, and probably has never had it all her life, when suddenly Ben struts into the picture. This may explain why she continues to work when she doesn\'t have to. She is used to the job, she thrives for the intensity, and perhaps uses it to fall deeper in love with Ben. Figgis doesn\'t come out and give you a reason why Sera continues along her path, but instead leaves it up to your imagination and enjoyment. Leaving Las Vegas felt like a combination Breaking the Waves, Love Liza, and All the Real Girls. This is a love story with so many different human elements coming to you at once that the average viewer would probably ignore the signs and see this as a depressing film. While it isn\'t the lightest film of the ages, it does prove that ""Love is a very splendid thing"".I cannot end this review without at least mentioning the amazing acting done by both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. The chemistry between them is rare in Hollywood. I felt that these two really made this film and were just not placed in their roles to sell tickets. Cage really felt comfortable and understood his character while Shue fit perfectly with her secrets and heart. It is obvious why Cage won the Oscar for his role in this film, and while I am sure we will never see him take a role like this again (thanks to summer blockbusters), it was good to see him take a role that really redefined the romance genre. The same goes for Shue. While she hasn\'t really made another film like this one in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.Overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.Grade: ***** out of *****', ""It's not a movie I could bear to watch very often, because it's sad to see people destroy themselves. But Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are riveting to watch here. As a person who has a past involvement in alcohol and substance abuse, I found Cage's performance especially compelling, and after watching him in this one, I am sure glad that lifestyle is behind me!The chemistry between these two is really great, two people that need each other in different ways, trying to cope with how screwed up their lives have become. Very real performances, if you're faint-of-heart be ready for some strong words, and not just obscenities. Wow! They really lay it on the line. Great performances by two of my favorites."", 'The strength of this film is that you like the people, despite their enabling and their weakness. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of this disease I\'ve ever seen and while the movie made me crawl, it was more than effective. Nick Cage\'s character recognizes all that he is. He has come to terms with his self-destructiveness and warns people to stay out of his life. He has flags up everywhere. His counterpart makes the mistake of falling in love with him. She goes through the hell that every person who has a significant relationship with an alcoholic goes through. Her life is no bed of roses and so she embraces his love and companionship, but like the proverbial snake, he is still a snake: it is his nature. The acting here is superb-- the characters so real we have trouble watching them. They move through the ""normal"" world. She grows to believe that if she sticks with him, he will come around. She can\'t overcome the puzzle of the control that the booze has on him. To her, if she is that important to him, he will change. There\'s the rub. See this movie but be prepared for what it is about.', ""Having recovered from the mind-numbing Heat, a supposed character study, I was eager to sink my teeth into a different 1995 gem and I found it here with Leaving Las Vegas. With only two important characters, the entire film rests heavily on the shoulders of Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, and neither of them disappoint.Of the two, Nicolas Cage is the Oscar winner and the truly deserving one at that. He is simply hypnotic as Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic so far gone he doesn't even remember why he wants to die. His withdrawal scenes are so real they are upsetting, whereas his drunken charisma is so real its almost funny. The balance that Cage strikes really highlights how tragic his character really is. He conveys hatred and rage and loneliness and despair, and you will be so sad yet so hooked that its impossible to look away. Elisabeth Shue gets off to a slower start than Cage, but she is still an endearing, emotional character, capable of great things.The writing is very good, giving Cage the perfect, pitiful dialogue in order to serve his woeful character, and even throws in a hypnotic monologue or two. The best thing that Figgis achieves in this film is his cruel and deliberate intersplicing of mood-killing incidents (invariably caused by alcohol) between the moments of love and passion that Shue and Cage share. It is a relentless reminder that their love story is completely doomed. Sting's My One and Only Love is all over this film, which I thought was a very good choice, in addition to the beautiful and haunting score.The final act focuses a little too much on Shue and not enough on Cage, and whilst their final scene together was appropriately pathetic to suit the tragedy of the film, I couldn't help but feel less engaged. I also didn't enjoy Shue's constant commentary, given that it doesn't really go anywhere.But between the raw passion of Nicholas Cage and the uncompromising guiding hand of Mike Figgis, any complaints I could ever have otherwise found in Leaving Las Vegas are completely washed away.""]"
25,26,114057,16420.0,"['Director Oliver Parker wanted to make Othello a more ""pacy"" story, so he omitted quite a lot of the original text when writing this version for the screen. Luckily, the cuts and alterations that he has made do little damage to the old Shakesperean chestnut. I wouldn\'t say that any of the tweaks are particularly for the better, but the essence of Shakespeare\'s tale of envy, jealousy and deceit is so powerful that it would take a bungling fool - an Ed Wood wannabe, for instance - to rob it of its power. The weighty themes shine through as strongly as ever in this latest presentation. Laurence Fishburne plays the titular character, a renowned Moorish soldier. His courage has impressed young Venetian lady Desdemona (Irene Jacob) and the pair of them secretly marry. However, her father is displeased by this secret ceremony and he warns Othello that if she can deceive her own father then she may one day do the same to him. One of Othello\'s soldiers, Iago (Kenneth Branagh) fails to get a promotion of rank which he feels he deserves, and to gain revenge he engineers a series of lies and incidents designed to convince Othello that his wife is being disloyal to him by fornicating with another man. Inevitably, viewers may find themselves comparing this version with other productions. How does it rank alongside the 1952 Orson Welles version and the 1965 Laurence Olivier one? To be honest, it depends upon the viewer. Purists would probably opt for the Olivier offering, since it is only very slightly abridged and contains such strong performances that all four lead actors earned Oscar nominations. Film buffs might go for the Welles version, with its moody b&w lighting and a now-classic murder scene, not to mention the fact that the production history itself is as fascinating as the story. This version will undoubtedly find favour with viewers more inclined towards modern tastes. It has high production values, a sweeping score, accessible delivery of the lines, flashy photography, and ""cool"" stylistic touches (Fishburne\'s head tattoo, for instance). Personally, I feel the 1952 Othello will always be the benchmark, but this one is reasonably well made and it compares quite favourably with other versions.', 'As my Shakespeare Professor had mentioned, the part of Othello is highly challenging, which is why many don\'t perfect it or intend to play it. Larry Fishburne however did a magnificent job!  He provided us an astonishing portrayal of how even a noble, righteous and even intelligent man, can succumb to ""the green eyed monster.""  The calculatingly evil Iago was FLAWLESSLY portrayed by veteran Shakespearian actor Kenneth Branagh, who occasionally stared into the eyes of the camera itself, explaining his dark plans and expectations.', ""I rented this film mainly to see Kenneth Branagh once again, but was totally surprised by the entire cast, especially Laurence Fishbourne who portrayed Othello brilliantly. The dignified, regal Fishbourne transforms Othello into a tragic figure with restraint, control and believability. It was also an added surprise to see two actors from Brahagh's Hamlet: Michael Maloney and Nicholas Farrel. And any film with Nathaniel Parker is a pleasure. Branagh brought a depth to Iago that I hadn't seen before, especially during the scene on the beach when he and Othello hug. Iago in tears? And then again at the final scene. Iago was evil, yes, but for an actor to find a few moments to make him human -that's when the audience knows something extraordinary has happened on stage or screen. See this film."", 'While maintaining the location and time period of the original play, this film gives us a much clearer insight into Othello as a character and as a story than many of the supposedly more important versions. The dialogue is trimmed to what is essential, the settings are atmospheric, and the cast is great. You will never forget the story after you see this version.', 'I\'ve always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh\'s versions of the Shakespeare classics, as he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who lifts the whole movie, is none other than ""the-always-great-actor"" Laurence Fishburne. Surely he has made some poor choices in films, even though he\'s a wonderful actor, but in this one we\'re truly given the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with Fishburne\'s well portrayed paranoia and, furthermore, we\'re finally given a black Othello!I don\'t think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes...? Branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, Iréne Jacob\'s Desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, whilst Laurence Fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Do watch it.', ""Othello, the classic Shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, actually I found Othello to be probably my favorite Shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was, the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. I mean, when you really do study this story, you could go into so many philosophies on why Othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later on for my report I also watched this version of Othello and I have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness.Othello is the big time soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king finds out that Othello snuck off with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is infuriated, but excepts it. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his side man instead of Iago, who has stood by Othello. Due to his insane jealousy, he's out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he just mearly hints at Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with Cassio, never says that they are, just makes Othello think that it's happening. Othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him out.Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend that you read it. It's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. Othello the movie is also great and once again I recommend it, it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel, or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him. This is a terrific movie, great acting, good sets, and good direction, this is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story.10/10"", ""Spoilers herein.Possibly nothing is more fun than filmed Shakespeare, because few things offer as many paths for reflection. Shakespeare himself invented the reflective human in the first place, and the play itself has power. But anyone looking for this power doesn't go to the movies, they read the play. There's just too much engagement and too many levels to appreciate without the magical space that reading creates.No, we go to the movies to see what people have done with these opportunities. Its a metatext of sorts. Engineering a film like this is a matter of tradeoffs and (in the best case) commitments to a world view that because of the richness of the plays can be as rich themselves. Olivier did not understand this because he never understood film. But Branagh does. In his films, he does not make the choices one would expect: centering on the actor and emphasizing the language. Instead, he focuses on the space between the film and our minds and engages in an internal dialog about being and representation. He's chosen the few plays that work well with this.But Branagh is only a player here, and the decisions have been made by Parker. Parker is a smart artist who takes a wholly different approach; he's done it here and with the Wilde projects afterwards. In this world, the language is the center: not the metaphoric abstractions, embellishments and introspections but the language as a dramatic citizen. That language is imbued with force. Around this force, everything moves.Fishburne is a good choice for this strategy. I know of no other black actor who works with the language this way. Its a particular challenge for african-americans because the use of language takes on a personal identity in that `culture' and most black actors leverage their identity as a tool in addressing a role. Not Fishburne, he's a real actor in the sense that he understands the difference between who he his and what his instrument is.Branagh is given a strange task to do here. His special strength is the ability to create that abstract metalayer, put it between us and keep it alive. But Parker will have none of that. Instead, all the metastuff is pushed into the more direct method of Iago's looking at and speaking to the camera. Its not very satisfying, but one can see why it is done.Similarly, Desdemona and all the other woman are treated by Parker the same way he did with his Wilde adaptations: they are secondclass beings, existing only as marks for the movement. Demoting her thus was necessary for the strategy I suppose. But it is a major loss, transforming the play into being about Othello alone, instead of the rich confabulation of conflicting forces of life in the `real' play. She has her erotic moments instead, but this is like the Branagh camera-glances -- a pale substitute for her richer life of sense and passion.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."", 'For me, the Lawrence Fishbourne version of ""Othello"" is the best ever put on film. His performance is excellent, while not overpowering the villainous Iago. And the title role is played by a black man, as it should be, rather than a white man with boot-polish on his face. The film\'s marginal eroticism has been criticised, but isn\'t eroticism at the very heart of the story? Olivier\'s ""Othello"" was essentially a film of the stage production, and for me the Orson Welles version was a failure, despite Welles\' star performance, because most of the other actors were almost devoid of charisma. How could Desdemona possibly have been interested in a slob like Welles\' Cassio?I have always found the original play unconvincing, for several reasons. Iago\'s motive, resentment of Cassio\'s promotion, seems too trivial for the tragedy it precipitates. At risk of committing heresy, I found the Verdi opera more convincing, with the soliloquy by Iago explaining his innate determination to commit evil.Also, given the closeness of Othello\'s friendship with Iago, his decision to bypass him in favour of Cassio makes little sense. Likewise, Othello\'s readiness to believe the worst of Desdemona, and the ease with which Iago leads him on to murder, makes the title character look quite pathetic, almost simple-minded.In this film, the cutting of the text to the absolute minimum helps to hide the play\'s inherent faults and tighten the action, and Fishbourne\'s wordless suffering speaks volumes that more than make up for the loss of Shakespeare\'s lines. I couldn\'t help comparing this film with Kenneth Brannagh\'s ""Hamlet"", the longest and most tedious of his self-advertisements, in which every long-winded speech was preserved intact. Here Brannagh\'s Iago is almost as good as Fishbourne\'s Othello, and he makes the most of the lines he has.To sum up, ten out of ten. I can only regret that Fishbourne is not offered more roles of this quality.', ""shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time.  The language somehow breaks the time barrier.  but perhaps it is the actors who really do that.after the disappointment in Romeo and Juliet (the version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), was hesitant take on another modern rendition of Shakespeare.  To my surprise Othello was great!Iago's character was played so well by the Kenneth fellow!  even thoough Iago is really evil and despicable, the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be, a pleasure for the audience to hate.  i have to say that fishburne's performance here was really good as well.i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book) alike.""]"
26,27,114011,9263.0,"['""Now and Then"" is very simular to ""Stand by Me"". Thats why I saw it. It is a girlie film but I did enjoy it and even own a copy! It\'s only flaw- it\'s cliched (but hey, I\'m a horror fan, so I really shouldn\'t complain!). Four friends all aged 12, an over- weight kid that gets picked on. The four friends have to cope with loss, death and of course.... adolescence. All these things were brought up in ""Stand by Me"". Despite ""Now and Then""\'s flaws, it is, in general, a great coming of age flick. Well acted and has a great cast of young and adult actors. The comedy is better in this film than it is in Reiner\'s 1986 hit. And seeing as this is a comedy, it delivers. A fun filled ride into adolescence!', 'In this coming-of-age story set in both the 1970s and 1990s, the younger cast is brilliant and natural, particularly Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffmann. The script soars with female teenage humor, friendship, and pre-puberty naivete -- a sprightly soundtrack of 70s tunes takes older viewers down memory lane. But then, just when the story about four best friends during summer vacation in a new housing development is clipping along at a compelling pace, SLAM! The film jumps forward 20 years and the girls are grown-ups. And at these points, the movie groans along like a garbage disposal with too many potato peels crammed in it.Remarkably, the dismal acting of these veteran actresses isn\'t as bad as the lack-luster script during these ""flash-fronts"". Were there separate writers for this film? I usually adore Rosie O\'Donnell, but casting her as the grown Roberta was a horrible choice. Demi Moore\'s character is now self-absorbed and self-pitying, and Melanie Griffin (super-famous actress) and Rita Wilson (pregnant homemaker) are insipid caricatures. None of these women are one-quarter as interesting or delightful as they were when they were adolescents, particularly Roberta (Ricci/O\'Donnell). The film\'s flipping back and forth between the decades becomes quickly annoying.Suggestion: Rent the video, and fast-forward through the adult stuff. Fast-forwarding the tape won\'t rob anyone of the film\'s message (something like ""friendship is forever,"" or ""don\'t go into cemeteries at night""), and it\'ll save you about 30 minutes of fidgeting, waiting for the film to turn back to the four girls. At least they have fun. And the treehouse they save up to buy is every girl\'s idea of truly cool!', ""My daughters (ages 10 and 12) and I love this film, we cherish this film. We laughed, giggled, cried, hugged, and bonded.  I highly advise this film to all mothers and daughters.  Some warnings.  There is a brief scene where some skinning dipping boys are chasing the girls who have stolen their clothes.  It begins with a very quick shot of an older boy's penis as he flips into a pond (I didn't see at first, but my daughters did after repeated viewings and use of the pause button), followed by a discussion of male erections by the four girls.  The scene is so well written and handled that parents could actually use it to break the ice in the discussion of sex with their children.  I did.  The girls then proceed to steal the boy's clothes and are chased on their bicycles by the four boys who are seen nude from the rear.  This scene is played so innocently and cute that a parent need not worry about it, though I have noticed my girls rewinding that scene.

I never tire of Ciaran Hinds, there seems to be so many layers in what he brings to his far too infrequent roles in films. I believe he is mainly a stage actor.The story bears truth to Jane Austen's original work, and I am a long time fan of Austen.Amanda is not glamorous in her role of Anne Elliot. But her truth and honour stand steady in the ebb and flow of the values, minor complaints and minutiae of her family life. It is clear from the beginning that she is the one with all the missing qualities in the others.Fiona Shaw also captivates in the role of Mrs. Croft who strikes out in a completely different kind of lifestyle for the era, sailing the seven seas with her husband and sharing his adventures.8 out 10. Well done to all concerned."", 'I loved this film by Roger Michell. Adaptations of great literary classics are fraught with dangerous shoals which have all been blithely avoided in this superb adaption of Jane Austen\'s masterpiece about love.There isn\'t a false move in the entire enterprise. The casting is perfect and the performances flawless. Special kudos to Amanda Root\'s brilliant, subtle performance as the heroine Anne Elliot. Ciaran Hinds, as Captain Wentworth, is virile, handsome and highly attractive as the lonely sea-farer come to land after years of fighting in the Napolianic wars.Not only is this a ripping love story it is imbued with great humor and pathos as well.There is nothing ""high-fallutin\'"" about it either. Not for one instant does the nasty face of preciosity enter in. The film speaks TO the viewer not at him from a high place.There are some brilliant vignettes, notably in the person of Cinnamon Faye as the honorable Miss Carteret. She doesn\'t have a single word to utter but in her facial mannerisms conveys a hilarious portrayal of the empty-headed daughter of the nasty Viscountess Dalrymple. Only in the very last scene does Ms Faye utter and that is simply to emit the silliest sneeze I\'ve ever heard. One of the brilliant and rare moments of exquisite comedy to be seen in a film. Other standouts in the cast are John Woodvine and Fiona Shaw as the Admiral and his devoted wife. Sophie Thompson turns in a wonderful performance as the ever-whining, obnoxious younger sister, Mary, who, along with the elder Elliot daughter, Elizabeth, burden the long-suffering Anne with their uselessness. Phoebe Nicholls, of Brideshead Revisted fame (she was Sebastian Flyte\'s youngest sister Cordelia) contributes yet another wonderful performance in her career, as the ill-tempered Elizabeth, ultimately conveying the tragedy of the burgeoning spinster in the last scene.Even if great literary classics aren\'t your ""bag"" don\'t miss this minor masterpiece if you happen to love great film-making.', 'For some reason, people seem to leave ""Persuasion"" out when they are naming Jane Austen adaptations.  I find that lamentable, since it is such a wonderful film.  It is exceedingly British, which means that Americans might find it a little hard to understand, but personally I think it is superb. \nAll the acting is stellar; I can\'t really identify a bad performance. Ciaran Hines especially shines as the warm but reserved Captain Wentworth.Of all the Jane Austen adaptations (except ""Pride and Prejudice"") I believe ""Persuasion"" is the truest to the time period.  The characters act within the conventions of regency England and seem to be comfortable doing so.I would recommend this movie to any Jane Austen lover or a person who enjoys period films or classic literature.  A person who does not fall into those categories might enjoy it as well, but is likely to find it slow and difficult to understand.', ""This is a very well put together, and yet very fragile movie that shows its budget constraints all too well. Beautifully acted and written, the direction unfortunately reveals the boxy nature of a TV screen. But despite the lack of impressive cinematography, the scenes are set up extremely well. The use of staging and visual metaphor are jaw-droppingly fantastic. Austen's relatively simple potboiler has been turned into a work of visual art that reveals the director's love for the material.The music is done perfectly - it doesn't overpower or ever impose interpretation, instead it is just enough to maintain focus on the story. And I love the understated nature of the characters. It is easy to spot the hypocrites, but you can see why they are the way they are. It would be very easy to make Mr. Eliot into a simpering, unctious idiot - instead, he is played as a gentleman. It makes Anne a better character, and it makes the movie a better experience."", ""Simply perfect! From the cast to the production design and direction, this bbc film is the best and most definitive version of Jane Austen's last and (for me) best novel. Anne Eliot as played by Amanda Root starts out as tired and pale when we first meet her, as her previously rejected suitor Captain Wentworth returns. Ciaran Hinds is probably a little old, but the perfection of Fiona Shaw, Corin Redgrave, Sophie Thompson and pretty much everyone else raises this film. Shout out to that gorgeous opera song too. A masterpiece!"", ""Jane Austen's novels lend themselves to cinematic adaptations. This production, directed by Roger Michell, and with a screen treatment by Nick Dear, comes close to be what Ms. Austen wanted us to see, if she had any saying in the matter. The film is blessed with great talented English actors who feel quite at home interpreting for us the rich text of the novel.Amanda Root, is perfect as Anne Elliot, the down to earth woman at the center of the story. Ciaran Hands is a virile presence that plays well in the story. Their romance is seen coming all through the proceedings and their love seems to be real.Corin Redgrave is perfect as Sri Walter Elliot, the fatuous man who was impressed with money and power. Susan Fleetwood has some excellent moments as the kind Lady Russell. Fiona Shaw is perfect as Mrs. Croft and Samuel West excels at his portrayal of the impoverished Elliot cousin.Ultimately, the production has a great view because it was filmed in the area that is described in the book. The beautiful city of Bath is seen in glorious exteriors.Recommended to all Jane Austen's fans because the beautiful job Roger Michell did in bringing the novel to the screen."", ""I enjoy Jane Austin best of all when it is free of the Hollywood temptation to populate her cast with handsome men and beautiful woman.  Anne Elliot is attractive not because she is some buxom blonde, but because her character is intelligent, quiet, and generously caring.  The photography in this film is extraordinary as are all the performances. Colin Redgrave is fabulous as Anne's father, a sniveling social climber, and Samuel West as the seedy relative who tries to get back in the families good graces to make sure that his fortunes are preserved.  The actresses playing Anne's two sisters also do a praise worthy job.  I recommend this film highly even if you aren't an Austin fan."", ""Following in the BBC's fine tradition of producing outstanding costume dramas through the 1970's and 1980's, including versions of Jane Austen's novels, this Bafta award-winning co-production, with WGBH and Sony amongst others, of `Persuasion' (her final complete work published mid rewrite in 1818, the year after her death), was made in 1995 with a stellar cast of British stage actors, many from the Royal Shakespeare Company with numerous TV credits. The film's events converge on the time Napoleon has been banished to Elba and the Battle of Waterloo of 1815 is still a year away.  Among the servicemen returning home is Captain Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds) who has been at sea for eight years since Anne Elliot's (Amanda Root) rejection of his marriage proposal.  The Captain is now a man of prosperity and social rank while his former nineteen-year-old love interest has matured into a \x91faded and thin' old maid of twenty-seven in service to her family.  Anne has lived to regret her mistake in being persuaded by her friend and patroness, Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood, `Heat and Dust', who sadly died the year `Persuasion' was released), to refuse Wentworth as a man of unsuitable temperament.  Whilst his affection would now seem to be directed towards her brother-in-law's sister, Louisa Musgrove (Emma Roberts), Anne's only romantic hope lies in the dubious and underhand attentions of her cousin William Elliot (an obsequious Samuel West, who was memorably the ill-fated Leonard Bast in `Howards End').  However, the accident on the Cobb at Lyme Regis requires Anne's sensible advice on how to handle the crisis and eventually leads to a second chance for her.   Incidentally the Cobb was to play another starring role in John Fowles' `The French Lieutenant's Woman', with Karel Reisz' 1981 dramatic movie version embellishing it with a strikingly cloaked Meryl Streep braving the elements, ensuring that it will remain a tourist attraction in perpetuity.Ostensibly with concern over the intellectual inequality of Captain Benwick's sudden attachment to Louisa after the accident, Captain Wentworth makes the impassioned declaration to Anne regarding his friend's broken hearted loss of his fiancee: `A man does not recover from such a devotion to such a woman, he ought not, he does not', but is patently reflecting on his own lasting strong feelings for Anne.  Surely it is wiser to recognise when adoration for one person is no longer appropriate and a chance may lie with someone else.  The supposed difference between the sexes regarding fidelity is discussed with Jane Austen adding the comment to her argument that the authors who view women as more fickle, have all been men.  This last remark in the film is rather improbably but modernly given to Anne, who also makes the bold claim for her sex that it is capable of `loving longest when all hope is gone.' It is not a question of gender but of genetic makeup and whether you are truly monogamous, as Western religions and society would decree us to be, or true to yourself. Although comfortable, life must have been dreadfully dull at times for the women in this world who could not relieve their tedium as their menfolk would by going off to war.  This observation is endorsed by the couple of scenes depicting a concert and an evening of card playing, tinged with amber candle light infusing gentle nostalgic warmth to the proceedings which is at odds with the atmosphere of bored ritualistic entertainment.  The different levels of lighting are used to subtle effect here and contrast with the cold glare of Ang Lee's brilliantly lit interiors in his working of Austen's first novel `Sense and Sensibility', also produced in the same year.Amanda Root (`Mortimer's Law', and as Fanny Price, another of Austen's independent women, in `Mansfield Park' for BBC Radio 4) is brilliant as the quiet understated heroine with luminosity to her face that beautifully transcribes the full gamut of emotions she experiences from servitude to the blossoming of love.  Her co-star, Ciaran Hinds (`The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover') is equally gifted of expression, with a barely repressed anger and resentment towards Anne, under the guise of curt civility that eventually he is forced to recognise masks his continuing passion for her. Interestingly over the next two years both leads went onto appear in different versions of Jane Eyre, with Amanda Root well cast as the kindly schoolteacher Miss Temple in Franco Zeffirelli's 1996 version and Ciaran Hinds as a suitably anguished Mr Rochester in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation.Jane Austen's fable may be recognised as the classic fairy tale of Cinderella, of a good hearted and dutiful daughter put upon by her foolish and snobbish father and cruel sisters, but who is eventually saved by her true prince.  With great effect, the author adds to the romance her wit and sense of humour to explore the characteristics of the genteel world she lived in with all its human frailties.  Nick Dear's screenplay, together with Roger Michell's necessarily less frantic direction than in `Notting Hill', adroitly captures the essence of Austen's narrative to provide one of the finest visual interpretations of her work.  Strong supporting performances are also given by the ensemble of Corin Redgrave (`Enigma') as the supercilious father; Sophie Thompson (`Emma') and Phoebe Nicholls (`The Elephant Man') as the far from ugly sisters of hypochondriac Mary and haughty Elizabeth; and Fiona Shaw (`Jane Eyre') and John Woodvine (`Wuthering Heights') as the companionable Crofts. Obviously complying with its `Beautiful People' culture the original cover of the American video version replaced the demure leads with two glamorous models, as a spokeswoman for Columbia Tristar in California has said, `I guess to make it a little more seductive to us over here'.  Nonetheless, it is pleasing to read that this film was well received in the States especially as it remained true to its British identity, and therefore set an exemplary standard in not pandering to an anticipated overseas market by using well-known international stars."", 'The recently released DVD provides a wonderful opportunity to revisit this exquisitely done Austen.  Her usual themes of elligible young women and men, their social positions, and their incomes, are very much in evidence; however here there is something a bit quieter and more deeply felt, as two special people get a second chance at happiness.  The direction is remarkably fine-tuned, and the production makes a welcome attempt to portray a more realistic glimpse of the life of various classes during the period than is usual.  The flamboyant period costumes are particularly amusing, and the sight of the naval men striding along jettys in uniform with their very striking hats is one that has always stuck in my mind.']"
28,29,112682,902.0,"['I can\'t help myself: I adore this film. I freely accept that it\'s not going to be everyone\'s cup of tea; if pushed, I might even accept that it\'s not perfect. But there\'s no film I love more, or more enjoy re-watching.  One caveat though: I\'ve seen both the subtitled and the dubbed print, and the English dubbing frankly comes close to ruining the movie. Ron Perlman dubs himself and is fine, and some of the other adult English actors are perfectly OK, though they tend to be blander than the French originals. But most of the children are terrible, and with her own voice it\'s Judith Vittet\'s extraordinary performance (all the more extraordinary considering she was nine at the time) that helps give ""La Cité"" the genuine emotional centre that some viewers don\'t feel it has.But I\'ll come back to that.  In any version, at least Jeunet and Caro\'s astonishing visual flair and artistry come over. I can\'t think of a film that has such a concentration of memorable shots - time and again, especially watching on DVD with a freeze-frame facility, you realize how many beautiful compositions Jean-Pierre Jeunet gives us: though the cast of characters could easily fill a freak show, and the sets are dark and quite unglamorous in themselves, the cinematography is gorgeous and the mise-en-scène often strangely elegant. It has a look all of its own, perfect for a modern, urban fairy-tale.  The music too is gorgeous, one of the finest scores by David Lynch\'s regular musical collaborator, Angelo Badalamenti.""Fairy tale"" is I think the best generic starting-point for this film, so long as you think Grimm rather than Disney. (Unlike ""Delicatessen"", it isn\'t really a comedy, though it has comic elements). And the plot works according to its own logic, even if the progression from scene to scene is occasionally a bit lumpy or obscure.  Krank (the astonishing Daniel Emilfork), grown prematurely old because he cannot dream, uses a cult of blind, messianic preachers to abduct children from a decaying industrial port and steal their dreams - but they have only nightmares, and Krank falls ever deeper into despair and evil.  It\'s up to the orphan pickpocket Miette and a none-too-brainy circus strongman, One, to put a stop to him.  This rich idea is elaborated with all sorts of visual conceits and eccentric characters - Jeunet mounts, for example, a couple of astonishing sequences in which chains of unlikely effects proceed from the smallest of causes - but never at the expense of the central relationship of One and Miette.\nIn a sense Miette, like Krank, has grown old too fast: the orphaned street-children of this city are savvy and unsentimental, and never seem to have had a childhood; meanwhile there\'s something deeply childish, in various ways, about most of the adults.  Sensitively directed and never overacting, Judith Vittet\'s Miette gradually thaws, and Ron Perlman brings a lot of sympathy and pathos to what could have been an oafish, cartoonish role: Jeunet gives plenty of space and subtlety to their gradually-developing friendship, and dares to do what I suspect no English director would dare to do at the moment, which is to make their relationship innocently sexualized. Neither of them is really a grown-up, but it\'s still an extremely risky move, exploring the first stirrings of pre-pubescent sexuality while trying not to be exploitative or prurient.  I do think the film pulls it off, though I can imagine some viewers feeling distinctly uncomfortable with it. For me it\'s one of the most convincingly unsentimental and nuanced (if mannered) portrayals of childhood I\'ve ever seen on the screen, and there is real compassion and tenderness along the way, as well as some darker twists and turns.It\'s a film that rewards analysis if you\'re prepared to surrender to its strange world with its strange rules. But it rewards the senses and the emotions too - and it radiates love of cinema as the perfect medium for sophisticated fantasy.  One elderly actress who appears towards the end (Nane Germon) acted - as Jeunet\'s DVD commentary points out - in Jean Cocteau\'s ""La Belle et la Bête"" about fifty years earlier (there are, by the way, distinct references to the Beauty and the Beast story here), and ""La Cité des enfants perdus"" deserves to join that film as one of the classic cinematic fairy-tales.  Pity about Marianne Faithfull over the closing credits, though!', 'In a surrealistic and bizarre society, children have been abducted by a mad and evil scientist, Krank (D. Emilfork), who wants to steal their dreams and stop and reverse his accelerated aging process. When the gang of Cyclops kidnap Denree (Joseph Lucien), the little brother of the former whale hunter One (Ron Perlman), he is helped by the young street orphan girl Miette (Judith Vittet), who steals for the Siamese Pieuvre (Geneviève Brunet & Odille Mallet), to reach the platform where Krank leaves with his cloned dwarf wife Mademoiselle Bismuth (Mireille Moissé), his six cloned sons (Dominique Pinon) and a brain, and rescue the children.""La Cité des Enfants Perdus"" is a mesmerizing movie, with one of the most beautiful cinematography and music score of the cinema history. This surrealistic, dark and bizarre fairytale is almost perfect, and my only restriction is the quite confused screenplay. When I saw this movie for the first time in 1995, I was impressed with the stunning performance of the young actress Judith Vittet and I expected that she would become a star, but eleven years later I have just read in IMDb that she quitted her promising career and now she is graduated in Economics Science. The soundtrack of Angelo Badalamenti is another wonderful work of this outstanding composer. I love the sequence that begins with the tear of Miette and ends with the ship hitting the harbor. I am also impressed with some sick twisted-minded persons that can see pedophilia in the beautiful relationship of One and Miette. I have this movie on VHS, but I have just bought the recently released DVD, and I do not regret, since this film deserves the better image and sound of the DVD. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Ladrão de Sonhos"" (""Thief of Dreams"")', '""The City of Lost Children"" is unquestionably one of the most imaginative and exceptional films of the entire 90\'s decade and it pretty much represents an entire sub genre all by itself! It\'s a dark and often disturbing fairy-tale, but nevertheless magical and child-friendly. Since this is a film by Marc Caro & Jean-Pierre Jeunet, you simply know to expect a unique and surreal story (remember ""Delicatessen""?) filled with extravagant characters and bizarre dreamscapes! It\'s enchanting to observe and quite challenging to follow, as there\'s always some ingenious gimmick to distract your attention from the main plot. I got hooked on it right from the GENIUS opening sequence in which a child\'s dream about Santa Claus slowly turns into an eerie nightmare. The action then cuts to the ""main"" character; the evil Krank who\'s unable to dream himself and hence kidnaps orphans in order to steal their dreams. Krank has an army of semi-human androids, one brother cloned six times, an uncanny midget-mother AND a malicious brain in a fish tank! Ron Perlman is a good guy for once! He portrays a simple-minded yet friendly strongman, assisted in the search for his abducted little brother by a witty young girl. ""The City of Lost Children"" is an amazingly energetic and vivid adventure and no self-respecting cinema fanatic can afford him/herself to miss it! It\'s funny, frightening, emotional and intelligent all at once. The decors are mesmerizing, the music is dazzling and the special effects are staggering. I can keep on mentioning good aspects, but it all comes down to one thing: watch this film!!! It\'s still regretfully underrated and we urgently need to change that!', ""I'm a fan of fantasy films. It's a mixed bag of a genre on all truth. Very rarely are there any great fantasy films. There are good ones or average ones that can merely get by on their looks. I do love the fact that fantasy films can paint such vivid and imaginative picturesque settings. As an example look at Legend. That was one of the best looking films ever made but the content of the film was not great. It was poorly scripted with hokey dialogue and a storyline aimed at 5 year olds, with creatures and effects that would scare the pants off younger children. Now you look at the best ones and the rare ones that can be called classics with greats of other genres like Lord Of The Rings and in a more Sci-fi orientation, Star Wars. City Of The Lost C children is a French fantasy aimed at a more mature audience member, from 15 up really. It looks fantastic. The sets, the costumes, the effects, the cinematography turn this 15 million dollar film into something looking far more epic and majestic in scope. Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro take joint plaudits and credit as directors, Jeunut more responsible visually and Caro for the character and story. This is endlessly imaginative and immensely enjoyable and is very quirky.The story centres around a mad scientist, Krank, who is unable to dream, because of this he is aging quickly and is old beyond his year. He grows insane and has developed a technique to view and capture children's dreams so he can thereby inject them into his own mind. He kidnaps children from the nearby village and brings them to his lair, a king of oilrig in the middle of surrounding sea. He is aided by his brothers who are four identical clones of each other, unfortunately they all suffer from narcolepsy. Krank himself is a clone. His father who created them is now merely a brain in a tank and Krank was an unfortunate mistake who doesn't dream. The only clone who was right is an enigma called the original who has long since escaped the insanity of this evil lair only to be living underwater and a kind of insane junk collector. One day strong man, One, and his little brother are ambushed by Krank's men and One's little brother is kidnapped. Thus far Krank's captives have proved unsuccessful in his quest for a cure, because they all suffer terrible nightmares, partly due to his own nastiness. All this latest young victim responds to is food, he seems to have no fear and it seems he could be the one, just as long as Krank keeps feeding him. One sets out on a quest to find his brother meeting Miete, a young a troublesome orphan girl in the process. It's all good fun this film and while the story is simplistic it's a kind of delightfully Grimm fairytale sort of story that keeps your interest.The cast are great. Ron Perlman is one of those cult actors who everyone seems to like and he has hit it big with the recent success Hellboy. He is a strong presence and unlike many musclemen of his stature he can act, something which has held him back somewhat because people have never really cast him as a leading action man, although in truth he's not blessed with good looks. The interestingly named Rufus, a Juenet stalwart is also very good as the clones, while Daniel Emilfork is excellent as Crank. Also good and a charming innocence is Judith Vittet as Miette. Anyone who loves a visually stunning movie should watch this film it looks amazing. The sets, the impressionistic and exaggerated designs are brilliant. It is typically French in it's verve. This is a fantasy fans wet dream, believe me! ****"", ""The City of Lost Children is my all time favorite movie.  It is unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced before.  It's a movie that I hold dear to my heart and will never forget.  I have to be honest though, the first time I saw this movie, I really didn't like it at all.  The story was too confusing, and the characters were extremely weird and twisted.  After watching it a second and third time, however, I understood what was going on more, and could spend more time looking at the visuals rather than the subtitles.  Speaking of visuals, this movie has it in spades.  The environment that Jean-Pierre Jeunet created is out of this world.  The city is very dark and the water looks as if there are secrets hidden within.  The mood the soundtrack sets is perfect for the scenery and the superb acting by everybody (including the kids) just adds to the greatness of this flick.  I highly recommend this movie, it's one of those movies that you will never forget watching, and the images will stay in your head for a very long time. A beautiful, beautiful, movie.  10/10"", 'The City of Lost Children gets two platinum stars and also moves up to one of my top ten favorite films of all time. This is a confusing story, from beginning to end it expands your mind, reaches into your nightmares, and creates a story that is part Dark City and part of a novel called ""The Golden Compass"" by Phillip Pullman. Yes, this film was everything and more. Not only visually beautiful, but the creative and symbolic meaning of the actions and words of the characters are ""jaw dropping"". Also, there are so many sub-stories in this film that reminded me of the style that Run Lola Run was done. This is the style that due to a connection of unrelated events something extraordinary happens. Let me give you an example from this film: There is a scene where the girl and One (Ron Pearlman-also a very biblical name) are trying to escape from the two women who want their jewels. There are events that lead from a dog finding its female companion to a boat almost hitting/splitting the women in half. Wild coincidences...imagine this times ten, and you have this film.Keep in mind this is a French film with English subtitles, so you are not only getting the true voice of the film, but seeing the darkness of the cinematography without any American input. This really shows the purpose behind making this film, it really takes you to a new place so dark and dreamlike that you the viewer actually feel like you are in the picture itself. A movie about dreams and nightmares that takes place in a world of dreams and nightmares. Overall, a heavily religious and symbolic film, The City of Lost Children should be put at the top of your foreign film list. Put it in your DVD player, open your mind, and be ready for a wild and intense ride!!Grade: ***** out of *****', '""City of Lost Children"" is a beautifully-realized if derivative dark fantasy in which a mad scientist named Krank, aided by a half-dozen clones, a midget woman, and a brain in a tank, abducts children to his offshore lab so he can steal their dreams.  Seems he\'s unable to have any of his own.  A sideshow strongman, played by a radiantly fit Ron Perlman, goes in search of his little brother, who has been taken by Krank\'s goons.  Perlman, in another of his growing gallery of bizarre roles, is a perfect example of why I like character actors better than big-name stars.  And how many languages does he speak, anyway?  French here, Spanish (and English, of course) in ""Cronos""; polyglot in ""The Name of the Rose""; what next?The strongman, named One, enlists the aid of Miette, a homeless, streetwise girl who, along with her fellow urchins, is part of a ring of thieves employed by a pair of sinister female Siamese twins named the Octopus. (Watch carefully how these evil twins smoke a cigarette. There are more weird characters per square inch in this flick than anywhere else outside a Heironymus Bosch painting.)  Miette is played by Judith Villet, whose gonna-be-a-great-beauty looks, her air of intelligence and experience beyond her years, make her a sort of Gallic Natalie Portman. \nAnyway, that\'s the plot: rescue little brother from the mad doctor.  The images are the thing: with its rendering of a bleak, low-tech retro-future, ""City"" looks more like a Terry Gilliam movie than ""Twelve Monkeys"" does! And it slyly slips in ideas and images from other sources, to good effect: Krank himself is as much of the mad-doctor stereotype as is the character in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""; his outlandish electro-headgear is similar to that used in Disney\'s ""Merlin Jones""; a nightmare on the loose swoops low along the ground through streets and alleys as a trail of green mist, improving on a similar image from ""Bram Stoker\'s Dracula""; there\'s a confrontation in dreamland a la the ""Elm Street"" series; and while the idea of a brain in a tank isn\'t a new one, this is the first benign one I\'ve ever seen.  Familiar or not--and I\'m thinking also of ""The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T""--""City of Lost Children"" is still engaging, enjoyably weird, fantastic and funny, helped greatly by the fact that One and Miette are so endearing. The pace is a tad slower than it might have been.  But this is, after all, a French movie.', ""I sought out this film after seeing another film from the same production team that made the wonderful DELICATESSEN. However, while I adored DELICATESSEN and gave it a very high score, I wasn't nearly as impressed by CITY OF LOST CHILDREN--mostly because this film seemed to emphasize set design and weirdness, while plot seemed almost unimportant. In DELICATESSEN, there were of course the weirdness and odd sets, but the story and acting was so much more important and this made me care much more for the characters. In CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, it felt more like I was gawking at a freak show and there was just no emotional involvement--none.In many ways, the film was reminiscent of several of Terry Gilliam's films--particularly BRAZIL. However, once again, BRAZIL had better characters and made me laugh. CITY OF LOST KIDS was just creepy and weird but with practically no charm.Now this isn't to say it's a bad film or that I didn't like it--I did. But instead of an involving or funny film, it was almost all visuals and weirdness. As for the plot, it sure took me a long time to even understand what was happening--and it seemed like I needed captions to explain the captions as I read along with the film!! But given the amazing sets and cool characters, it still kept my attention. I particularly enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinon playing a bunch of clones. I have liked this odd looking actor ever since I first saw him in DIVA and he was the best character in both this film and DELICATESSEN. His delivery and manner is just captivating.Now usually in most of my reviews I give a summary of the plot. Here it's very tough because I still am not 100% sure what I saw!! It all involves an evil genius who was created by one of the Dominique Pinons. This guy spends much of the movie kidnapping kids and trying to steal their dreams (kind of like an evil twist on MONSTERS INC.). At the same time, some evil freaks led by conjoined twins are thrown in as rival baddies. In the midst of this, Ron Perlman (who speaks no French in real life) and a little girl set off in search of Perlman's stolen little brother. There's more to it than that, but really I didn't think the story was that important--it was more a chance to give a canvas to all the weird sets and characters.Overall, I liked seeing the film but I never came close to loving it. I recommend it for those with an appreciation for the very weird and perhaps lovers of French cinema. All others, proceed at your own risk."", 'Written for English class my freshman year in high school.Lights! Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet, what makes a great movie?  In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course,  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So, for all the reasons above, I consider ""The City Of Lost Children"" the best film of 1996.The plot of ""The City Of Lost Children"" is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called ""The City Of Lost Children"" (hence the title).   One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One\'s little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder).  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story,  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song (""Who Will Take Your Dreams Away"") by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.The casting director of ""The City Of Lost Children"", Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film.  In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman\'s performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too).  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.Another reason for me choosing ""The City Of Lost Children"" as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. ""Jeunet and Caro"").  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film\'s special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today\'s blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary, the special effects of ""The City Of Lost Children,"" however, are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank\'s laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.Was the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.  From what you have read, whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away (I do understand that this movie does have a select audience), I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint.  Even if the story will not appeal to you, it is still splendidly done.  Overall, though, ""The City Of Lost Children"" is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.']"
29,30,115012,37557.0,"['Here\'s something you don\'t see every day - a mobster movie that focuses on the evil of criminals, instead of their coolness.  ""Shanghai Triad"" shows you how mob violence destroys the life of a gangster\'s moll and endangers her innocent, fresh-from-the-country servant.  It\'s exactly the kind of story you wouldn\'t see in a Hollywood movie - which is, I suppose, why we watch this weird foreign stuff!Gong Li is, as ever, forceful and compelling, with a role that\'s infinitely more interesting than what America\'s ""lead"" actresses usually get.  She\'s very glamorous here, and totally unlike the peasant characters she played in ""To Live"" and several other films.  What a wonderful, versatile actress.The film\'s other strengths include gorgeous, award-winning cinematography, interesting point-of-view shots, and an effective shift from an urban to a country setting that\'s pulled off very smoothly.  It\'s a shame that this is the last film that director Zhang Yimou and Gong Li made together, but at least it caps off their collaboration on a high note.', ""This is a fine movie - wonderfully acted, beautifully shot, quite simple. Without being heavy-handed, one comes to sense the presence of real evil that tempts and corrupts and destroys. It's a little slow at times because the story is so simple - yet the slowness and simplicity does allow the messages of the movie to hit home. Something else I like is that the protagonist boy is not made to be cute or winning - he just is who he is - largely an observer but sometimes acting with generosity and sometimes with contempt. Much has been said by others about the beautiful cinematography and that's certainly true - but I'm also struck by the amazing work of those who constructed or chose the sets, costumes, background characters - they were quite memorable. What a star in Gong Li, and what a director!I don't agree with those who contrast this with American movies - surely we feel the same evil in watching either version of Scarface or The Petrified Forest or The Road to Perdition. In fact, I would say this movie is most like The Road to Perdition of any I've seen - not in its story particularly but in its tone, its simplicity, its contrasts of character, its cinematography. This is also a good movie for those who say they don't like foreign movies - you'll like this one."", ""The big plus here is in the visual department It is gorgeously filmed with deep, rich colors.The story isn't that much. You keep excepting it to get better. It holds that promise but doesn't deliver until the ending, which has a neat no-nonsense twist. I really liked and admired that ending and wish more movies had realistic finishes like this.Gong Li, who stars in here, plays a character that is interesting for the first half of the film but her spoiled-brat routine gets annoying after awhile. The main gangster, however, is an interesting guy throughout.I've watched this twice and, frankly, expected more both times."", ""This story is told through the eyes of a boy who has just begun working as an underling for a Chinese mobster in the 1930s. It seems the young man is the servant to the mistress of the triad chief and he is treated, at times, more like a slave than a person. The lady is quite beautiful but also seemed very petulant and foolish throughout the film--making it very surprising indeed that this boy bonded so quickly with the lady. Had I been in the boy's place, I probably would have taken the first chance to either poison her or run! SHANGHAI TRIAD was nominated for the Best Cinematography Oscar and this certainly isn't surprising when you see this film. It's actually pretty rare for a foreign film to get this nomination, but this movie was one of the most artistic films I have seen in ages. The camera-work is great--with the wonderful use of filters, excellent framing techniques and grand colors.Unfortunately, while the film is very beautiful, the story itself is too often sterile and one of its main characters (played by Gong Li) is just too unlikable--seeming like a complete brat. While the mob boss is quite amoral and vicious, at least you didn't find yourself hating him quite as much--especially since he was a smart guy. Additionally, all too often, events occur off-screen and you only hear about them or catch glimpses of the results--giving the film very little energy. Fortunately, despite being slow, the film does end very well with some interesting twists--but not quite enough to redeem the film. Overall, it's very watchable but with more energy and a more involving story, it could have been so much better."", 'A young boy is brought to 1930\'s Shanghai from the countryside to be the manservant of a gang boss\'s mistress. The mistress (Gong Li) is a glamourous nightclub singer and a royal bitch. Soon after he arrives, the boy is witness to a power play in the underworld that results in the uncovering of lots of treachery and quite a bit of violence.It\'s a nicely constructed story with good acting from everybody involved. It\'s fairly straightforward, but satisfying, and seeing the gang land activity from the perspectives of two outsiders makes it all the more interesting.SHANGHAI TRIAD became my favourite Zhang Yimou film when I saw it some years ago, for the simple reason that it was one of the most beautiful films I\'d seen. The production design, costumes, lighting and camerawork are all quite remarkable - creating stunning images from the opulence of Shanghai\'s nightclubs and mansions to the simplicity of the rural island where the second half of the film takes place.Unfortunately, the R1 DVD fails to do the film justice. The colours are far too subdued, giving the film a rather lifeless look, and the demon of the digital age, Edge Enhancement, rears its ugly head again. The result looks rather like a VHS transfer, but I\'d swear in court that the film looked a lot better on my UK VHS copy (mainly because of the colours). Poor Zhang Yimou, he hardly ever seems to get good representation on DVD.The film is recommended for fans of Zhang Yimou or Gong Li, though without the vibrant cinematography the film wouldn\'t be ranked as his best by many people. If you\'ve already got the film on VHS, it\'s not worth ""upgrading"" to the DVD though.', 'Gong-Li and film making partner Zhang Yimou have another fine hit;  in a series that is beautiful filmmaking as well as one the government would find disapproving of the reality of triads.She plays a ""moll"" , also a singing star triggering more than an ample reward for the conniving under bosses who would try to topple the boss.Stunningly photographed and acted, maybe near the Hang Zhou coast (or a rare unfilled canal in Shanghai?) ... with his beautiful concubine, and the narrative device of a young male orphan as fellow observer; the Boss hits the mattresses due to an attempted murder from within; and retires to an island to discern the traitor giving orders to kill anyone who arrives or leaves the island without his permission.Then the Boss waits, and Gong-Li idles no longer singing in the cabaret; and the ""smoke out"" begins.Excellent poignant drama  sensitively photographed.As in all her films, and the directors, the people as bystanders and victims of any corruption is a subtle attended theme!', ""This film is, foremost, a gangster film, but Zhang Yimou tells it from a much more interesting angle.  As far as the plot about moles and trying to find the traitor in the group, it's old hat.  What isn't, however, is seeing how the children, practically enslaved by a triad boss, begin to slowly turn into the type of people that Tang and Bijou are throughout the movie.Another refreshing change was, despite Tang's wealth, the triads are not romanticized like the mafia often is in this country.  Tang, unlike Vito Corleone, is a ruthless killer, born and bred, not a family man forced into a situation.  What impresses me most about Zhang Yimou's films are the cyclic nature, where everything comes full circle in the end.  For many, the colors and political messages are the topic of discussion, but watching events carry out within a restricted time, and follow the Eastern idea of cyclical rather than linear time, is more interesting, since these characters continue to develop in one's head even after the movie has ended."", 'This could be an American gangster movie except that it is so beautiful. Well, that and the fact that it takes place in Shanghai in the 1930s. Gong Li plays Xiao Jingbao (""Bijou"") the moll, a self-centered, vain, mean, slutty songstress kept by the ""Boss"" (Baotian Li) of Shanghai\'s underworld. As usual with director Zhang Yimou every set is gorgeous and artfully planned, the story compelling, and the human psychology veracious.We see the events through the eyes of Shuisheng (Wang Xiaoxiao) a 14-year-old boy from the country who, because he is a member of the trusted Tang family, is brought to the city to be a servant to Bijou. She treats him and everybody else like dirt while she plays the Boss for a fool. We can guess that her comeuppance will be severe. Oh, but HOW severe? In this Zhang Yimou goes beyond what one has seen in American gangster movies and gives us something from Machiavelli and Genghis Kahn.The film is a little slow in parts and Gong Li plays her role so well that she is most disagreeable—that is, until what I might call the ""turn."" This occurs when she is forced to go with the Boss to the country after a rival has attempted to kill him. Bijou is bored. There is nothing for her to do so she goes to the house of a country widow named Cuihua (Baoying Jiang) with a nine year old daughter Ah Jiao (Yang Qianquan) to lord it over her and to amuse herself with these country bumpkins. But the surprise is that in the process she is returned to her childhood when she herself was a country bumpkin. Zhang Yimou plays this part of the film masterfully as we slowly realize that Bijou is jealous of Cuihua and her poor but idyllic life. But that is something she can never admit to herself as she spies on Cuihua with her lover. One almost gets the sense that Bijou would like to be in Cuihua\'s place with that crude country lover.At one point Bijou makes Cuihua loan her some of her peasant clothes and then takes delight in wearing them. We can see that Bijou is in denial about how much of a slave to the master she really is and how unsatisfying is the life of a kept woman regardless of how well kept. She realizes that her life is empty. And now we see a certain generosity of spirit: she gives the boy some silver coins; she tells the boss to spare the woman, but it is too late. Because you talked to her she knows too much, he says. He adds, you see, it is your fault again.This film sits well with the current communist government of China despite or perhaps partly because the Boss with his small round eyeglasses looks a little like a Chinese Trotsky. But more importantly Zhang Yimou\'s depiction of the criminal decadence of China in the 30s before the rise of communism is exactly what Maoists like to see. Communism freed the Chinese from all that, is perhaps the idea.This is not the only film of Zhang Yimou\'s to play to communist sensibilities. His Raise the Red Lantern (1991) also shows in a different way the moral corruption of what might be called the ancient regime. But Zhang Yimou can be forgiven for playing to the powers that be because he does it with subtle irony and for a purpose, the purpose being to give himself the celebrity and an international reputation so that he is able to make films that might in some way criticize the communist state while he maintains a position of loyalty to that state. Working from within, it might be said. We see this in his To Live (Huozhe) from 1994 in which the hardships under communism are not euphemized. To be more exact it might be said that Zhang Yimou sees the excesses of Mao\'s regime but realizes that Mao was a stage through which China had to pass; and at any rate, who would want to go back to the time of the capitalist gangsters? The airy, white tops of the reeds wave in the breeze. The colors are straw and the cottage on the island is neat and holds out against the rain. Inside Cuihua cooks and weaves a basket. She is content. Bijou, in her red dress and her red lips, wearing her jewelry and her superior manner, is not. She recalls the mulberry trees of her childhood and how she would climb the trees and eat the tree-ripened fruit. All the riches in the world cannot bring back those days, nor can she return to them.She would like to take nine year old Ah Jiao with her back to Shanghai. Ironically Ah Jiao in her innocence wants to be like ""Miss,"" which is Bijou\'s ""title."" Ironically, however, it is the Boss who takes the little girl back so that she can grow into the next Bijou.The ending of the film is as brutal as anything you might expect to see, and yet there is a kind of poetic justice in what happens. In part. Zhang Yimou is always about politics, even though the politics are sometimes ""just"" domestic politics, as in Raise the Red Lantern. But he does the politics in a way that leaves no doubt: justice or what comes to pass is shaped by those who hold the power, whether it is the power of the state, or the power of the gangster boss, or the power of the master of the house, not by those who do not hold power. And that is the trenchant reality behind the great beauty of any Zhang Yimou film.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)', 'There has been way to much chatter about how beautiful this film is with its sumptuous sets, costumes, and magnificent photography.  On the surface this looks like another gangster film, this time taking place in Shanghai.  But of course, it isn\'t.  The gangster scenario is just the backdrop really.        Shuisheng, a boy of 14, has come to the city to serve the haughty and beautiful Xiao Jingbao, the nightclub singing moll of Tang, head of the most powerful gang in Shanghai.    Shuisheng\'s uncle is a riot as he gives the boy a whacky set of instructions on how to be a proper servant to snobby Xiao, wonderfully played by Gong Li.  ""Call her \'Miss\'.  Follow her wherever she goes, not to far behind, and not to close.  That\'s the rule.  Hold her coat in your left hand and her hat in the right, but don\'t let the coat drag on the floor. That\'s the rule.  Got it?""  And the Shuisheng replies, ""Got it.""  However, after ""Miss"" delights in calling him a country bumpkin, and chews him out a couple of times, (And why not, Shuisheng can\'t tell a red dress from a green one.) the kid starts looking for the exit.  When his uncle tells him, ""When she rings for you, stop everything (yes, everything) and go to her.  Got it?""  His reply this time is, ""I want to leave.""  Bad move, uncle is most displeased.           In many ways, Shuisheng is the most inscrutable character in the movie. He\'s got a real poker face, and you\'ll probably have a tough time deciding if he\'s an idiot, or a sharp kid who\'s observing things closely and learning fast.  This is the heart of the film, the relationship between the boy and the woman.  Eventually, the boy will find out the self-important, hip swinging Xiao Jingbao is miserable. She is the beautiful songbird hopelessly trapped in a world where she is bathed in luxury by the ruthless Tang, with no hope of freedom.         The boy\'s whole attitude changes when he realizes this, and the question the film poses from here is ... what, if anything, can he do about it?  If this was an American film, (and I\'d love to see such a version) probably plenty, but director Yimou Zhang is a cynical man with a dark outlook on life.  All his films have downbeat endings, and this one is no exception. What really bothers me though, is that events take place that result in a complete shift in setting half way through the film, and that\'s always a dangerous move in the cinema.  And this abrupt shift comes at a time when things are just getting interesting in the nightclub, when Shuisheng realizes ""Miss"" is very unhappy.  He might have been able to help her in the big city and spacious confines of the nightclub, but marooned on an island, there\'s not much he can do.      This is a good film, but I would have liked to see the plot move in a different direction in the second half.']"
30,31,112792,9909.0,"[""I had no interest in seeing this movie when it came out in 1995. It just seemed to be another movie about angry inner city youth struggling to graduate from high school. So running into this tonight, I finally decided go give in and give it a watch.My final assessment is that although this movie bears comparison to a long list of great-teacher-inspires-kids movies, I now embrace the movie because Michelle's portrayal brings it over the top, also, I was positively impressed with Renoly Santiago's honest and sensitive reading.It is easy, as I am ample testament, to dismiss movies that appear to be clones, but since this was reportedly based on a true story of an ex-military woman, it either demonstrates that the story does not emerge from the minds of banal-thinking writers, but from fact, or that the stories like these repeat themselves daily in the fabric of America and need to be told under as many guises as there are stories. WHY? Because all of us need inspiration and hope in our lives."", ""One thing I've learned through th years is that use your own opinion when it comes to movies. Just because someone says it a bad movie doesn't quite mean you wont like it. Dangerous Minds is an excellent movie. I've read reviews on this movie and saying that this was just another Hollywood movie. Their wrong! I watched this movie and I was really impressed by it. For me it was truly inspirational. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent in this movie. There are some who says that Michelle isn't  tough enough to play the character, but sorry to burst their bubble but it's called acting. You can be the weakest person on earth but if your truly a good actor then you can make anyone believe your a tough guy or girl. The music was awesome.  The cast was great. The Plot and script was exceptional. I recommend this movie to anyone. You wont be disappointed. I sure wasn't."", ""This movie gives us a little hope that there are people in the world prepared to go to extreme lengths for the good of others. This is a heart warming story, and although at times it's quite tragic, it shows a growing bond between a group of socially discarded students and a very special teacher.Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is simply wonderful, she captures the passion and warmth of her character perfectly. The rest of the cast are a little mixed, but there is plenty of strength in their performances to cover any cracks.Overall this is a highly emotional and educational journey, that is enjoyable to watch.8/10 If you enjoyed this watch 187, its even better."", 'Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an ex-marine hired as a teacher in a high-school, where the students are Afro-Americans, Latinos and poor persons. She has recently separated from her husband and her friend and also teacher in this school Hall Griffith (George Dzundza) got this temporary job for her. After a terrible reception from the students, she tries unconventional methods of teaching, using karate, Bob Dylan lyrics, friendship and attention, and gets the trust of the students on her.I like this movie a lot and probably today I have watched it for the fifth or sixth time! It is a remake of the wonderful ""To Sir With Love"", updated for the end of the Twentieth Century: instead of England, USA; instead of the Afro-British engineer Mark Thackeray performed by Sidney Poitier in a Caucasian classroom, the blonde ex-marine Michelle Pfeiffer in a Afro-American and Latino classroom; instead of Lulu and the final dance, a rap (music and dance); instead of a museum, an amusement park. The soundtrack is marvelous, but the introduction of the movie in black and white with Coolio\'s ""Gangsta In Paradise"" is overwhelming and fits perfectly to this magnificent movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Mentes Perigosas"" (""Dangerous Minds"")Note: On 16 Oct 2020, I saw this film again.', 'When this movie was first released, I refused to line up and watch it. I thought it was another of those simplistic and ""popular"" - love the teacher, fight delinquency - movies. In fact I refused to be taken for granted by clever Hollywood people who, usually, produce very ""sweet"" and ""educative"" movies. Well, a couple of years later, while I was refurbishing my own movie collection I stumbled on a special LaserDisc sale and bought this one as well (just to see what all the fuzz about it was really about). First of all, I was amazed to know that it is based on a true story, just like ""Lean on me"" and what caught my attention was that the teacher in question didn\'t belong to that profession: she was a discharged and unemployed USMC officer. I expected a war between her and the pupils she would ""drill"". What I received in return was an education on how one can be prejudiced, in more than just one way... Having served in the Swiss Army and having been a teacher myself, I could really empathize with the Character played by Michelle Pfeiffer. My first teaching approach, unlike hers, was disastrous to say the least... The entire movie deals with LITTLE, REAL, EVERYDAY problems and not with the big issues of life and this is probably why this movie was summarily discarded as being second rate. But when we consider how children consider and perceive our world nowadays, it\'s exactly what they expect us, the adults, to do as well. That\'s to say, take our time to explain to them the everyday happenings in their little worlds. Why mom and dad went their separate ways, why do they have to cope with homework they cannot understand and so on and so forth. This movie is a teaching lesson for teachers, not a moralizing or preachy one. It shows us how it should be done, nothing more. In Drama one says ""less is more"", why shouldn\'t it apply to life? We always want to set standards and a higher example to the students we are supposed to tutor, but what about our commitment to give them what they really want: lend them an ear when they talk, a heart when they feel sorrow, and sometimes, when required, a firm authority to look up to? Many colleagues I have met have forgotten what teaching is all about. It\'s not a simple profession to earn your life, it\'s much more than this, it\'s a mission, a passion, a drive, a call, just like the one an actor or a director have. In this instance in my own opinion, ""Dangerous Minds"" has amply achieved its goals. For the detractors of this tiny movie I would suggest to take a better and closer look, they might still learn something... But please, take your time and concentrate on it. This is really not a ""Popcorn"" and ""Beer"" movie.', 'Based on the non-fiction book ""My Posse Don\'t Do Homework"" (written by Louanne Johnson), ""Dangerous Minds"" tries but fails to cut to the heart of the social issues it discusses.  The main problem is that the script depends too much on dramatic convention, and too often chooses to take the easy way out rather than directly confronting the reality of it\'s premise and characters.Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an ex-marine who begins a teaching career in a tough NYC inner-city school.  But she finds her pupils, from the inner-city projects, to be a rebellious handful in need of guidance as much as education.  She then decides to use her own methods to win them round to learning, against the wishes of her bureaucratic superiors...From ""Dead Poets Society"" to ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" this sort of plot has been rehashed a thousand times before, and ""Dangerous Minds"" is not brave enough to really attempt anything new.  The music (especially the Coolio hit ""Gangsta\'s Paradise"") has more grit and originality than the script.  Nearly all the stock characters from this sort of film are present in one form or another: the gifted but reluctant star pupil, the tragically flawed pupil, the resistant, reactionary parents, the list goes on.  The ending, as expected, is the typical happy-ending copout.The acting, however, isn\'t too bad and just about saves the film from becoming a complete bore.  Pfeiffer struggles with the central role, failing to give the part significant dimension or depth.  But she\'s well supported by George Dzundza as a fellow teacher, Courtney B.Vance in an underplayed turn as the by-the-book principal, as well as Renoly Santiago and Wade Dominguez as two self-destructive students.A missed opportunity as a movie, ""Dangerous Minds"" was later turned into a short-lived TV series with Annie Potts taking over from Pfeiffer as Louanne Johnson.', 'I really liked this movie very much, even if its nothing new.  I think every generation should have a movie in this genre - there have been so many, going back to ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"", that they must mean something to each new viewer.  This is pretty realistic, too, although some of it is a little sugarcoated, it helps to remember that it is a movie.  Pfeiffer is very good as the teacher struggling with several different things all at once.  I must also mention that I appreciate the fact that there was no obligatory love interest for Michelle\'s character.  I read somewhere that Andy Garcia was edited out of this movie, and as much as I like him, I was glad she didn\'t have a Supportive Boyfriend Who Understands.', ""For anyone who's lived the life portrayed in this movie are the only one's who truly know it's essence and value. For those who call it 'questionable' apparently haven't lived life outside of a plastic bubble. Dangerous Minds is an excellent adaption in its own and holds many memories for me and for others as well. I can't imagine someone not taking to this film. and being infinitely inspired. People tend to forget where movies originate from, they mainly based on real events and real life itself and what life is really about. I'll never forget what this movie has taught me and what it won't ever let me forget. Dangerous Minds is about love, hate, fear, and strength. Dangerous Minds is about life."", 'I\'m not about to call this movie a ""feel-good movie"" or a ""coming-of-age-tale."" What am I gonna do is call it what it really is - a great movie.Michelle Pfeiffer is at her best. She is absolutely fantastic in this movie. The actors in the classroom hold their own against her as well.Basically, the plot is as follows: White teacher enters a mostly-minority ""alternative"" (read: group of kids that act out) classroom and commands respect. In turn, she changes their lives as they change hers. It\'s basically the story of Raul, Emilio, and Carrie, and how they cope with life as a result of Ms. Johnson.The movie has some really good lines (my favorite: ""You asked me how I was gonna save your life. This is it. This moment."") and really good drama. Sure, some of it is hokey-it-only-happens-in-the-movies, but the majority of it is good. I\'m a guy, and I shed a few tears.Overall: 9/10.']"

Some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so I was a bit worried. Just because I felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that I had to watch several times to get. But I watched it last night and I was really impressed, this movie had everything in it: action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. The actors all did a terrific job, I give a lot of credit to Bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.James Cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. Animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send James to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. But the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by James, but he tells her more, and believes him. Now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.12 Monkeys was an incredible film. Like I said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. But the whole movie was just great, the cast, the sets, just the whole picture was a great one. It had a Terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.9/10"", 'In the future humans exist underground, the surface having become uninhabitable due to the release of a virus years before in 1996. The ruling classes are scientists and large sections of the population are held as prisoners in tiny cells; prisoners who ""volunteer"" to help work out what happened back in 1996 that killed off 99% of the population. Requiring information about the visit, James Cole is sent back to 1996 to gather what information he can. However, sent to 1990 by accident, Cole finds himself in a mental hospital where he meets From the very start this film marks itself out as being very much a Terry Gilliam product and those who hate his work will probably dislike this film for the same reason. However, pleasing people like that is not my concern and 12 Monkeys is actually one of Gilliam\'s most accessible films as it sets his imaginative style within a narrative that is satisfyingly complex and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. The story is not perfect though, the connection to the start is nice but the ultimate twist behind the virus just seems to have been thrown in to keep the film tidy; a minor complaint though because even then the main thrust of the story (Cole) keeps it together. The twisting plot plays with both Cole\'s and our sense of reality and it is genuinely gripping from start to finish Gilliam\'s direction is superb, whether it be the realistic world of the 1990\'s filmed with clever angles and shots or the wonderfully twisted world of the future, it is all excellent and was such a pleasant find in my local cinema at the time.The film benefits from great turns from the cast. Willis was having a bit of a career resurrection in the mid-90\'s when several films showed us that he could actually act \x96 for me, 12 Monkeys was one of them. Willis is superb as he spins from madness to sanity and back again; he underplays all the way and is so much better than the wise-cracking everyman that he is better known for. Pitt is just as good but in a different way. Getting an Oscar nomination that he deserved, Pitt risks overdoing it but pushes his crazy performance as far as he can without being indulgent \x96 I\'m not saying he is perfect but I would could this as one of his best performances to date. Stowe is very much in the shadow of these two but she holds her own well. Morse, Seda, Meloni and Plummer are all good in minor roles but really the film belongs to the lead three \x96 Willis in particular and Pitt in a great supporting role.Overall this is a great sci-fi; the story is great and is only helped by Gilliam\'s imaginative direction and awareness of the fantastic. Meanwhile the cast are very strong, with the famous leads giving some of their best performances to date. Downbeat, imaginative, engaging and one of the more accessible of Gilliam\'s films, it stands out as one of the best American sci-fi\'s of the past few decades.', ""Twelve Monkeys is typically Terry Gilliam, loaded with the director's trademark quirky visuals, and, as such, should get right up my nose (I'm not a huge fan of his hallucinatory, surreal style, to say the least). And yet I still love this unusual time travel tale: it's got great performances, with a particularly strong turn from the then up-and-coming Brad Pitt, and Gilliam's chaotic storytelling actually suits the inherent madness of the whole movie. The twisty-turny plot keeps the viewer on their toes throughout, and Gilliam pulls all the threads together neatly for the finale. The occasional moment of visual excess still niggles (the steampunk/trash-heap aesthetic of the future isn't my cup of tea), but on the whole this is definitely one of the director's best films.Bruce Willis stars as James Cole, a convict from the future who is sent to the past to try and discover the origins of the virus that wiped out most of the world's human population. After a violent altercation with the police of 1990, Cole is sent to an asylum where he meets patient Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), son of a wealthy scientist (played by Christopher Plummer), and quite possibly plants the seeds of mankind's destruction in the lunatic's mind. Together with his psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), Cole tries to prevent the disaster from occurring.At times, it seems as though Gilliam has only the slightest command of proceedings, and the film demands that the viewer puts in 100% concentration to avoid becoming as lost and confused as Cole himself, who becomes more and more unsure about what is reality and what isn't as the film progresses. Characters ramble, often seemingly incoherently, but what they are saying is, for the most part, intrinsic to the outcome, so pay attention (or have your finger on the rewind button). Those who make the effort will be rewarded by a film that is constantly inventive and frequently clever, and worth at least a few viewings to appreciate it to the fullest."", 'Terry Gilliam\'s fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis\' best performance ever.What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to. Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed. As Willis asserts ""It\'s already happened,"" while he\'s in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it\'s Willis\' inner struggle to simply survive himself. It\'s a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam\'s unique brand of dementia.Besides this, 12 Monkey\'s storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock\'s Vertigo. All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery. With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters. The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis\' psychologist. She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false \'religion.\'Gilliam\'s expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness. Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.10 out of 10', 'In 1996, a deadly virus is released by a terrorist group known as The Army of the Twelve Monkeys and wipes out 5 billion people from Earth and the survivors are forced to live underground.\nIn 2035, the prisoner James Cole (Bruce Willis) is forced to return to 1996 to find the original virus to help the scientists to research the cure to mankind. However, he is mistakenly sent to 1990 and locked up in a mental institution, where he meets the lunatic Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). James Cole unsuccessfully tries to explain his assignment to the doctors, including the psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) that is responsible for his treatment, and then he tries to escape but is incarcerated in a cell. Out of the blue, he vanishes, in the beginning of the incredible journey of James Cole.""Twelve Monkeys"" (1995) is a sci-fi ahead of the time. The plot has many details that requires the viewer to watch this film more than once to fully understand the story. Watching ""Twelve Monkeys"" again in 2021 is particularly scary in times of the pandemic Covid. Hope that the history does not follow fiction. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Os 12 Macacos"" (""The 12 Monkeys"")', '""Twelve monkeys""\'s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam\'s masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. ""Twelve monkeys"" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in ""Die hard""). No matter how he tries, he\'s a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It\'s got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, ""twelve monkeys"" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.', 'Stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se. The fact that today\'s society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.Terry Gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film. He gives the movie a decadent feel throughout, showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy. His world, the world in which TWELVE MONKEYS transpires, is a place where the mad run wild, where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect, where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence, where madness looms at every corner. This is a very dark movie, but his very best, most linear (despite the plot twists which hold up under examination), and one which gets better with repeated viewings.A tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of Life On The Planet As We Have Known It leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity\'s fate on the Earth by employing renegade citizens -- the scum of the Earth -- as guinea pigs to go back in time, among them one James Cole (underplayed to great effect by Bruce Willis). Cole could be any person. We don\'t know anything about him, but in a way, that doesn\'t matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. What we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality: he may have already been at the scene of the Event of 1996.It\'s this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie. When taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets Jeffrey Goines (spastically played by Brad Pitt, Oscar-nominated here) who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction, and later Cole believes he has seen Goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping... what? He doesn\'t know. Later he meets a psychologist, Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), and one of her first reactions to him is that he\'s insane, and that she\'s seen him before. This becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive/resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that Something Terrible is coming This Way, especially when she meets him six years later: she has seen Cole before. At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (Jeffrey Goines?) has apparently escaped, not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander. The questions arise: have these events happened? Are they going to happen? Who is really a part of this, or better yet -- is everyone, down to the smallest player, a part of a Greater Plot? Or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which Time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again? These questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of Alfred Hitchcock\'s masterpiece VERTIGO in which Madeleine Elster/Judy Barton mourns her own brief existence (""You took no notice,"" she says, as Cole and Railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in). Snippets of dialog from VERTIGO form a foil to the dialog between Railly and Cole and later, when Cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for Railly, he comes face-to-face with her in disguise (looking almost exactly like Eva Maria Saint from NORTH BY NORTHWEST) as the swelling Bernard Herrmann score plays the emergence of Judy Barton, dressed as Madeleine Elster. It\'s a fascinating sequence, more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films: Madeleine Stowe plays Kathryn Railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench-coat and calls herself ""Judy Simmons"" while helping an ""insane"" man named James Cole; James Stewart plays a detective who tries to help ""insane"" Madeleine Elster who will later re-appear not once, but twice, first as brunette Judy Barton, and later, as Madeleine. Action and re-enaction, play and re-play.', ""A convict from the year 2035 is assigned a mission in order to win parole. He is sent back in time by a group of scientists to try and discover the source of a fatal plague that wiped out most of the human race. A plague which did not kill animals. In his travels he discovers mysterious graffiti announcing the arrival of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.Terry Gilliam has always been an interesting film director and visual stylist even when some of his movies are uneven. With 12 Monkeys he perhaps produces his most wholly satisfying work. It's a consistently compelling mystery within the framework of a time-travelling sci-fi narrative. It's a fairly complex story, so attention is demanded of the viewer. This is perhaps the chief strength of the film, however, as the labyrinthine narrative is one that benefits from multiple viewings. There are still some elements of ambiguity even at the end, so it's a film that actively encourages discussion.There's a good cast too. Bruce Willis was on a bit of a run in the mid 90's and this is one of the great films he appeared in at the height of his powers. On the other hand, it's one of the first films where Brad Pitt was allowed to display his acting chops and show that he was a lot more than just a pretty face. While in visual terms, it's as interesting as you would expect from a Gilliam movie; although not as phantasmagorical as some of his more personal fantasy features. In 12 Monkeys he was a director for hire but it's not immediately obvious. Perhaps the distance this gave him actually helped instill some discipline that made the whole more cohesive on the whole. Whatever the case, this is an excellent sci-fi film with a compelling central mystery."", ""Terry Gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast.  Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like -- better than McQueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's a don't-miss!""]"

It has proved to be anything but a flash-in-the-pan. This movie will endure. It\'s also a beautiful film on DVD with brilliant colors and some very rich visuals. Filmed in rural Australia, the scenery is magnificent and so is the house that is featured in the film. It looks like some old-fashioned gingerbread house. The animals are entertaining, talking to one another like humans but not looking hokey in the process. In other words, the dubbing is well done.The main character, ""Babe,"" the little pig, is the nicest, most innocent ""character"" you could ever hope to find. Listening to him talk is heart-warming most of the time and sometimes it\'s heart-breaking. The best comic relief is provided by the goose who wants to be a rooster. That may sound like it\'s geared toward little kids, but it isn\'t. I haven\'t found an adult friend yet who didn\'t like this film.It also was good to see James Cromwell play a nice guy, too. Most other times he seems to play profane and corrupt cops or government officials. Here, he\'s just a nice old farmer who blends in perfectly with the surroundings. His wife is a bit annoying, but not too bad.This is a wonderful, sweet-hearted comedy-drama with a nice ending, too, guaranteed to leave you with a smile or a tear, or both. This is one of the best ""family"" movies of all time.', ""Remember the times when a parent or a grandparent would read to a child in bed, so that the child can visualize the story and comfortably sink into his/her dreamworld? Well, 'Babe' feels like such a story. It is a heartwarming tale about a Pig (called Babe by her 'Mom') and her friends at the farm. Chris Noonan executes it in such a wonderful way. The film is broken into chapters (just like in a book) and the lovable talking animals appear like very real and humanistic characters. the lip-syncing is impeccable. Also, I liked that the film doesn't completely refrain from reality as it does show that pigs are killed for meat or that puppies are given away or sold to others. It stays honest. The voice-acting is very well done. Christine Cavanaugh's childlike voice remarkably fits Babe. Miriam Margolyes, Danny Mann, Hugo Weaving and Miriam Flynn are all pleasing. James Cromwell is wonderfully restrained. The setting is a make-belief story-book farm. I found myself wondering, 'Is this an English farm?' and at the same time being confused that the people were speaking with an American accent but there's really no need to pick on that because it simply doesn't matter. Just enjoy the beautiful farm and the lovely characters. 'Babe' is one of the finest family films. Kids will surely love it. Heck, even I loved it when I saw it during my late teens...and I still love it as an adult."", ""Babe is separated from his family and becomes friends with some of the animals on his new farm.  He learns that each animal has a role to play and that both he and Ferdinand the duck are fated to be lunch!  Both take new roles to escape their fate and Babe tries to become a sheepdog.  As Farmer Hoggett begins to notice the unusual way Babe can work with the sheep he begins to groom him for that role \x96 much to the worry of his wife and the other farm animals.Written by the guy who wrote the Mad Max films \x96 that's what kills me.  I know it's adapted but how can the Mad Max writer manage to deliver such a sweet film that is unassuming and comic and heart warming.  The plot is great as it is adapted from `The Sheeppig' but Miller's script adds so many comic touches that it's funny throughout.  The characters are all well written so that we care about them and get easily drawn in.It's directed well and again feels fresh and different \x96 whether it's the chapter set up or the use of the narrator or the way that the singing mice make the links it all works well.  Because it is gentle and unassuming I found myself involved in it so easily and the themes of finding your own path and friendship are not rammed down your throat but just sit there if you want to get them.  I've seen this several times and the silent, wonderful climax to the sheepdog trials makes me choke everytime (even if it is predictable).All the voices are good and the use of animals is faultless.  The use of animatronics is a little ropey at times but the sense of goodwill the film gave me extended to overlooking these minor complaints.  James Cromwell is just superb as the human face in this drama \x96 everytime I see him now I can only hear him say `that'll do pig'.  Babe is a great hero and you feel for him from the start to the end \x96 when he gives a little satisfied sigh it's difficult not to feel warm inside.Overall this is one of the best children's films I've seen \x96 it's light and unassuming and not a classic but it is comic, gentle and ultimately heart warming \x96 what more do you want?"", ""I think genre preferences go out of the window when a film like 'Babe' comes along. It's easy to see why this film is so universally popular, the story is delightful and the main characters so likable and endearing. The idea of a having a film centre on a cute pig may have raised a few eyebrows at first, but after only a few minutes any doubts anyone had will have gone.There isn't much I can write about this film other than saying how much I enjoy it every time I see it (and that's a good few times now). I never get tired of it and it's probably one of my go-to films when I'm in the mood for a family film. I'm yet to meet anyone who doesn't like 'Babe', I'm sure there are people out there who don't like it and I'd be interested to hear their reasons, but you'd be hard pushed to find a family film as universally popular as this one."", 'This is a family film in the classic sense of the word, and it\'d be hard to find a more charming and heartfelt tale. Ideally for children, but it can be enjoyed by adults too. It is a fantasy world where animals speak just like humans do.....albeit not in Australian accents, which is where the film is meant to be set.The hero of this tale is a young pig named Babe, who is transfered from the pig pen, to the village fête, to the hands of Farmer Hoggett who wins the little fellow in a prize raffle(James Cromwell). It is on the farm he meets the locals, and is taken under the wing by a kind sheepdog named Fly, who has been characterised as the warm and motherly type. Not so warm is Rex (voiced by Hugo Weaving of Agent Smith fame), her growling no nonsense other half, who believes pigs do not belong with sheepdogs.Babe is portrayed as the personification of innocence, and his gleeful and inquisitive nature brings him into contact with a host of farmyard animals. Not too sure why they felt he needed a furry little toupee between his ears, but each to his own. As Babe gets closer to Fly and the sheepdog role, he even begins to assume this role, much to Rex\'s dismay. But Babe has an awful lot of ambition for a little animal, and his heart is set on being a ""sheep-pig"".There are moments of sadness in this film, such as loss and death, but it is mainly sweet natured and enchanting.

A young-ish, single man at the time, I was dragged along oozing skepticism - but came out loving it unreservedly. I just watched it again with my two kids, aged seven and five, and watched them lap up the magic. It was wonderful to re-visit the film through their eyes. When The Boss takes the shotgun to the barn thinking Babe has savaged the sheep, they were genuinely fearful. They hated the laughter of the crowd at the sheepdog trials when Fogget appears with a pig. They cried when that derisive laughter turns to cheers (though not as much as me...).There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love Babe. And the lost. Stay away from the latter.', ""All too often, children's movies are simply insipid for adults who get suckered taking the kids.

I know when I took my then five year-old to come see it, we both enjoyed it and now 14 years later, we still adore this film as much as ever.There have already been a ton of reviews for this film and trivia on IMDb explains the complicated process by which the film was made, so I really don't want to get into this. Just suffice to say that by using very realistic puppets from the Henson Workshop and lots of live creatures, they managed to convincingly tell a story where the audience is pulled into it--and actually can accept that the animals talk and do other extraordinary things.What I love about the film is its tremendous sense of style. Not only does it have a wonderful idea, but the combination of great music, amazing cinematography, storybook farms that look like David Winter cottages, the best voice actors you can imagine and those wonderful mice all work together to make a film that is a truly unique viewing experience.Overall, what's not to like? I know some have actually seen this as a PETA or vegetarian plot, but I cannot imagine anyone not loving this film. And, if anyone you know doesn't like it, you should get some new friends! By the way, as excited and in love with this film as I was and am, I feel almost 180 degrees different about the abomination that was the sequel, BABE: PIG IN THE CITY.

But I know that this film is one of the best ones ever made. It\'s simple, beautiful, positive and original.The story is about a farm pig who wants to become a sheep dog. Pretty strange considering a pig\'s place is in people\'s plates. But Babe has something the sheep dogs don\'t have: gallantry. His kindness, determination and good intentions will make him a truly unique individual, one that stands out from his peers, proving that no matter who you are, you can make a difference.I love the way the story is made. It is cut into chapters with a bit of narration, giving us the warm ""grandfather story"" or ""old school"" feeling. It\'s a very comfortable ambiance, and every animal brings its personality into making an awesome story.Now I am sure you\'ve all seen talking animal movies before, with voice-overs. Babe took it one step further with the animals\' lips being in sync with their lines! Talk about realism!

33,36,112818,687.0,"[""Tim Robbins's 'Dead Man Walking' is a brave piece of cinema. Though the film is about a man on death row and a nun's struggle to help him, I liked how he presented both sides of the central theme of capital punishment. This isn't a preachy film about capital punishment being wrong or right as I doubt one's opinion would change on that after watching the movie. But, it's more of a subtle movie that tells the story of two people who form an unlikely friendship.This couldn't have been an easy film to make yet he manages to pull it off. Poncelet is a ruthless murderer and in no way does Robbins condone what he has done but he and actor Sean Penn manage to win Poncelet the viewer's sympathy. The execution is terrific. The last scene particularly stands out. We see, in flashback, what had happened while Poncelet meets his ultimate fate. We see how he and Helen make the final connection, we see remorse in his eyes, we see him dying a slow death and at the same time the horror of the crime is exposed to us. We know that what he did is unforgivable but he finally took responsibility for that which allows us to see him as a human being rather than a ruthless killer. This also makes the whole tragedy more astonishing because you just ponder, like Sister Helen, on how such a normal human being commit such a heinous deed? Both Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon deliver powerful performances. We pretty much see most of the film from Helen's point of view. Sarandon clearly has put a lot of heart into the role as she skillfully downplays her part showing tremendous depth and pathos. Sean Penn plays his difficult complex character with ease. The supporting cast do well (watch out for a young Jack Black and Peter Sarsgaard).The score is mesmerizing, especially the Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan tracks. I also felt that sense of isolation that was brought out in the prison scenes. The terrific writing grips the viewer's attention right from the start. Even though we can predict Poncelet's fate, we are drawn into the fascinating transforming journey of these two intriguing characters."", 'I haven\'t seen many films that really, truly made me rethink a long-held position or opinion on a thorny issue, but ""Dead Man Walking"" is one of them.I read Sr. Helen Prejean\'s book, upon which this film was based, when it first came out in 1993.  At that time I was utterly supportive of capital punishment -- to quote the script, I felt anyone who committed crimes horrible enough to land them on Death Row was an ""expendable human being, suckin\' up tax dollars.""  I also had personal experience with the issue when an entire family whom I knew in my childhood were slaughtered by a man who is now on Death Row for his crimes.As you might imagine, I was disgusted with Sr. Helen\'s book.  I thought that trotting to death row and holding the hand of some scumbag who\'d killed innocent people was about the lowest thing anyone could do, and as a Catholic I was offended by the seeming hypocrisy of it.Because I had disliked the book, I never saw the film until about two weeks ago, when I bought a remaindered copy of it in a video store.  I have watched it four times since then, mostly because I am trying to work out my feelings on it.  I am still a supporter of capital punishment, but it\'s going to be less easy for me to ignore the fact that (to quote again), ""There\'s nobody with money on Death Row"" -- and quite a few more blacks, now that I think of it, AND the fact that, like Matthew Poncelet\'s character, the men who are being executed are human beings who have feelings and fears. It\'s easy to jeer at Matthew on the day before his execution, fretting nervously about whether the lethal injection will ""hurt,"" like a little boy at the doctor\'s office for a penicillin shot, since his victims\' last moments certainly ""hurt."" What isn\'t easy is to realize that while the victims of these inmates didn\'t know they were about to die until it was too late, the inmates themselves have what seems like a blessing at first, but upon deeper examination is the greatest curse:  knowing the exact hour and day they will die, and having to face it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute.I\'m sorry if this review offends people who are sincere death penalty supporters.  I still consider myself to be one, but my thinking has been reformed somewhat and I\'m more ready to listen to the opponents and try to make compromises; maybe that\'s what this issue needs more than anything.  I will say finally that ONE part of this film did offend me as a Catholic: the symbolic ""crucifixion"" of Poncelet during the ""last words"" scene.  That was the one place where Robbins strayed from his even-handed approach to the issue -- the only one I could find.In all, this was a fine film that made me rethink an explosive issue, and I recommend it highly to anyone debating the pros and cons.', '\'It\'s easy to kill a monster, but it\'s hard to kill a human being.\'Set in St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, ""Dead Man Walking"" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana nun Sister who befriended Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple\x85 Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the end\x97an act never before attempted by a woman\x85 At their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life\x85 The film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the woods to die alone\x85 As Poncelet\'s execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him\x85 In one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, the kids for being there\x85 Poncelet never understood that he has robbed the Percys and the Delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sorrow\x85 They are never going to see their children again, never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them\x85 In the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity\x85 Luckily both Sarandon and Penn are here exceptional\x97carrying out successfully an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls\x85 When Sarandon was looking at Penn, she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears\x85 She asks him to visualize her as he dies\x97 \'\'I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love\'\'\x97in that moment, we truly believed that she\'ll be the face of love for him', ""Tim Robbins did a masterful job directing this film. I say this because he avoided convention and cliché. He also oversaw superb performances from Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more amazing, Robbins doesn't patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. I can't recommend this film enough, 9/10."", ""In a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick.  And to add some irony to it all, even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood, as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not.  At the heart of `Dead Man Walking,' directed by Tim Robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really-- and truly-- understand.  And it is what this film is actually all about:  Forgiveness.  Real forgiveness; not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof-- not saying that what's happened is okay-- but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life.\tDirector/screenwriter Tim Robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death-row inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in God.  As chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death-row inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola.  Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) was reaching out to anyone who would listen, when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience.  And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience.  Through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well.\tFor her soul-stirring, impassioned portrayal of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress.  Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of Poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began).  Whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, Sister Prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization.  It's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. \tTurning in a career-best performance, as well, is Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (he lost out to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in `Leaving Las Vegas).  Perfect for the part in every way, Penn has quite simply never been better, before or since.  He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here.  Not that it makes Poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact.  It makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things.  And that's the strength of Penn's performance-- it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul.  A terrific performance, and -- as good as Cage was in `Vegas'-- Penn should have received the Oscar for it.\tIn another stand-out performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix, father of one of Poncelet's victims. With limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is, at least on the surface.  Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.\tThe supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet).  It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended, was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what Robbins has accomplished with `Dead Man Walking.'  Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness.  For, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime's work.  And it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish; and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her.  I rate this one 10/10."", 'What\'s really good about ""Dead Man Walking"" is that it shows Matthew Poncelet\'s (Sean Penn) side of the story, but it never portrays him as a hero. We understand that, and Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) understands that. Sarandon definitely deserved her Best Actress Oscar for this movie (I can\'t believe that it took her so long to win one). Never preachy, the movie shows all sides of the story in looking at Poncelet\'s approaching execution. Among other things, this movie should dispel the notion that they don\'t make movies like they used to - although this one is over ten years old. A true classic in every sense of the word.', '""Dead Man Walking"" deals with one nun\'s struggle (Susan Sarandon in her Oscar-winning part) to help a convicted death row inmate (Sean Penn in an Oscar-nominated role) come to terms with his imminent execution. Writer-director Tim Robbins does something very difficult in this film, he makes us care about the unsympathetic character that Penn plays.  Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn dominate the film in every aspect imaginable, they play a complicated chess match at times and eventually become close friends by the end of the picture.  The fact that Sarandon and Robbins are openly against the death penalty in real life just adds to this film.  Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads.  4.5 out of 5 stars.', ""... cascade these three ingredients into the melting pot of literature, cinema, television, social media etc. and catalyse them with a story about the death penalty then you're invariably going to concoct as poisonous a brew that's as acidic as it is caustic, as polarising as any magnet, as contrasting as black and white, night and day, high and low tide. Whatever my views on the subject, I struggled to connect with any of the characters presented (on both sides) as deeply as I would have liked, performances were fine but not outstanding, I'm not sure the story was even that unique or original by todays standards.The one thing that does irritate however, that societies and cultures fail to resolve the root of the problem, that those with less opportunity continue to lose what little they have and the net that should save people form falling into chaos continually becomes smaller and more threadbare. Ultimately that makes us all culpable for the cause and effect of the world we've decided to inhabit and the unpalatable scenarios it continues to present us with."", ""There are few films where both the performances and directing are as powerful as they are in this film.  Sean Penn is nothing less than awesome in a film that is as unflinching, intelligent, and thoughtful about the death penalty as any film could be.  Writer/director Tim Robbins shows a depth beyond any reasonable expectation, Susan Sarandon is wonderful as the strong moral center of the film, and Sean Penn's performance is one of the most specific, thought provoking and eerily realistic performances ever put on film.  In short, his performance is a masterpiece, as is this important film.""]"

And I thought the love story though predictable was tastefully handled and fairly intelligent. All in all a most enjoyable experience."", 'Very enjoyable film! I watched it back in 1996 and I loved this film. The Olsen twins made great job the same like Kirsty Alley and Guttenberg. After this movie I became a fan of Kirtsy Alley and Olsen twins. One of their best movies. Since then I got it on the tape. I still watch it sometimes and it brings me back to the childhood when I was a kid of 10 years old.It is a simple film about twins that meet and want to change the worlds. Lots of laugh, funny situations and quotes. A summer vacation begin. Nice shots, very good script. A movie to learn from. This film is very suitable for kids. Good actors, cast, screenplay and action! A movie for whole family!', 'I saw this movie back when I was 12; I liked it then, and still wouldn\'t mind seeing it again. Like all kids\' movies, this movie has just a few corny kid moments that older viewers, especially teenagers, wouldn\'t prefer. But, unlike countless other movies, ""The Parent Trap"" included, this movie doesn\'t let all those annoying little things, like ""I love you, honey! I love you with all my heart!..."" get too far and make the viewer want to put a grim on his face and turn off the TV. They do it by using great acting skills by countless ingenious actors and actresses, and by not having a moment of nothing, but smiles, hugs, and extra-corny laughter get too long.Also, another advantage this movie has over ""The Parents Trap"", is that even \'though the main characters are both young girls, and one is an orphan in a group home, they are never portrayed as completely helpless, and in need of adult supervision; throughout the whole movie, all the adventures and gigs the girls think-up and go through they do with the help of no one, but themselves, and constantly help each other when either would get in a tough spot. The reason this is such a big advantage for this film is that in most real life, and most movies we see, all the main action is done and held by adults, and kids are treated as little and somewhat spoiled helpless creatures, who can\'t take care of themselves. This fact, often unconsciously, bores and sickens the audience, sometimes even bringing feelings of disgust towards kids. But in this movie, this problem is dealt with masterfully. Not only do kids here do things all on their own, but many times the adults, when in the same situation, look up to to them for help and advice. I thought this movie was made with a beautiful plot, truly great acting, very nice camera work, and, very importantly, very good character development: enough time is taken to introduce every important character\'s life before getting anywhere near the main idea of the movie. I would, personally, give this movie a 10/10, hands down.', 'It is movie for children. It is funny. Romantic. Kristie Alley and Steve Guttenberg are fit to each other. It is a good summer time movie that watch with your child.', ""I couldn't help but compare to the parent trap (it's the exact same premise, except everyone just decides to call it 'weird' that the two girls are identical).

35,39,112697,9603.0,"[""Director Amy Heckerling knows a thing or two about high school flicks, having directed the highly successful `Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. Heckerling put her talents to work thirteen years later for the next generation of high schoolers, writing and directing this hilarious satire of life at Beverly Hills H.S.  Heckerling takes a different approach from `Fast Times', which found its comedy in the absurdity of reality, depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves.  Here Heckerling's comedy mostly comes from mocking the superficiality of the high school `in-crowd'.  While this is not the first time this has been done, few have ever done it with such blistering wit.  This film became the standard for a spate of 1990's high school flicks set on the west coast that borrowed many of its elements.The story focuses on Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone), who is the most popular girl at Beverly Hills H.S.  Cher seems to be a superficial airhead, but this belies her conniving and manipulative skills at getting what she wants.   Superficial yes, airhead no!  In a plot derived in part from Jane Austen's `Emma', Cher works behind the scenes to arrange love matches between various students.  She even orchestrates a relationship between two teachers to improve their moods so they don't grade so harshly.  Like Emma, she is a master of love for everyone but herself.Heckerling does a fantastic job of presenting what seems on the surface to be a cotton candy story with lightweight characters, but really runs much deeper revealing subtle truths about human nature.  Her direction of the fledgling cast is superb, milking every ounce of comedy out of each scene.Silverstone sparkles in the role, which is probably not far from a reality with which she is very familiar.  She actually attended Beverly Hills H.S. with co-star Breckin Meyer, although she didn't graduate due to career commitments (she received a G.E.D.).  This film catapulted her to teen prominence with two MTV movie awards and an American Comedy Award as funniest actress in a leading role.  She plays Cher with both arrogance and vulnerability, and her comic timing is impeccable.  She also has a knack for physical comedy, with a broad range of contorted facial expressions and amusing use of body language.  The rest of the teen cast is also great, especially Brittany Murphy as Tai and Breckin Meyer as Travis.  Dan Hedaya is also priceless as Cher's work obsessed attorney father.This film is easy to like.  It is a light and funny spoof, but it still has nuance.  I rated it an 8/10.  For those who enjoy high school comedies, this is required viewing."", '""Isn\'t my house classic? The columns date all the way back to 1972.""When romantic high-school comedy Clueless (1995) was released, it was immediately vaulted into cult-status and firmly stapled as one of the most original teen-flicks of the 1990s. \'Original\' is perhaps a term wrongly applied since it is based on the queen of romance Jane Austen\'s Emma (1815) . But what Clueless did was update the classic story by coating it with high school drama, teenage girls and shopping and sprinkle it with heavy doses of humour.Emma is no longer Emma; she is Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a spoiled rich girl walking around in her Beverly Hills mansion in a bubble of stereotypes and teen-clichés -- but with a great big heart. So big-hearted, in fact, that she takes on the lost goofy new girl in her school to find her love and popularity, knowing full-well that it could destroy her own reputation. Clueless thus sees Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) on a mission to do good. Real good.All the detours this mission entail are captured brilliantly in the film, taking the form of love-interests, parties, shopping and misunderstandings. From Cher\'s grumpy lawyer-father (an hilarious Dan Hedaya) and her nerdy step-brother (a likable Paul Rudd) to her eccentric group of friends at school, Clueless is a superb ride of teenage comedy camp. Only just over 10 years old, it is still extremely dated today. But no matter, because the 90s clichés like skateboarding, Marky Mark and the catch-phrase ""As if"" just make it so much more contemporary and fun to watch. What elevates Clueless (1995) above generic high school comedy is its use of stereotypes. In most films they are unintentionally there to create a subconscious effect, but in Clueless they are made fun of to a much higher degree -- they are overblown and glorious. It brutally satirizes rich kids and their \'problems\' and juxtaposes them with a classic, heart-felt love-story. The kind that only Jane Austen can write.9/10', ""Clueless (1995) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture surrounds Cher, a upscale high school student with good grades, looks and lots of money. As she looks for love she's also happy playing match maker for her friends and a particular new student. As everyone starts finding love she finds herself starting to get jealous.This movie is directed by Amy Heckerling (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) and stars Alicia Silverstone (Batman & Robin), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Stacey Dash (Moving), Donald Faison (Scrubs), Jeremy Sisto (Wrong Turn) and Wallace Shawn (The Princess Bride).The writing for this picture is excellent with fantastic characters, dialogue and circumstances. The cast is perfectly selected and Silverstone delivers her character to perfection. The soundtrack is also good as is the comedic content. The terminology is good and the teachers matchmaking, driving scenes and couples conversations all made me crack up.Overall this is a very well done picture that is an absolutely must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."", ""Just the other day I watched Heckerling's wonderful romantic comedy satire 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' and I thought I'd revisit 'Clueless'. The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.Then the class distinction too is cleverly demonstrated through the eyes of Cher. The characters too work on multiple levels. Cher appears to be a popular stuckup bimbo type lass but once Hecklerling allows us to dig a little deeper, we see that she is unintentionally manipulative and knows how to use her strength (her power of persuasion). Yet, she is good at heart and even though her initial intentions of getting the two teacher together was to get an A grade, she's happy with the outcome of her matchmaking and the acts that follow are with more sincere purpose. Tai too appears to be the dumb new girl but she is far more experienced than Cher and when opportunity strikes she makes a place for herself in 'society' (i.e, highschool).Alicia Silverstone plays the part as though it was made for her. She has the right looks, age, excellent dialogue delivery and is a total natural in performing. 'Clueless' was the film that made her an overnight star and a very promising actress however, unfortunately, her following movies have been disastrous and the actress rapidly vanished into oblivion. She is supported by an equally great cast that includes a goofy Breckin Meyer, a weirdly fashioned but still gorgeous Stacy Dash, a naive Brittany Murphy, a laidback Paul Rudd, a hilarious Donald Faison, a bitchy Elisa Donovan and a fire breathing Dan Hedaya.For me 'Clueless' is among the top teen films along with movies like 'Heathers'. Those who childishly dismiss it as a fluffy chick-flick don't know what they missed. I was watching '10 Things I Hate About You' which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of Thew Shrew' and while that film failed to engage me for the most parts, 'Clueless' succeeds in all departments because it's much more than just another teen flick. It's a highly entertaining satire and it's a nuanced teen comedy with a subtle social comment."", 'Silky-smooth, vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school. Far from the insufferable smugness of all those \'80s teen-flicks, ""Clueless"" is bright--in both senses of the word--clever, funny, fanciful and yet grounded in reality (a rich one). Alicia Silverstone is adorable, but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked (they all get their share of funny lines, particularly Dan Hedaya superb as Silverstone\'s father). Seems more inspired by Jane Austen\'s ""Emma"" than based upon it, with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters. **1/2 from ****', 'Cher (Alicia Silverstone) is a popular ditz at her local high school in Beverly Hills. She\'s a spoiled, pampered little princess with all the right social connections and endless wealth. However she has yet to find a man in her life - all the Baldwins (as she and her clique of friends call guys they like) have been taken.When Cher receives a foreign exchange student, she takes her under her wing and decides to try and find her a boyfriend - ironically without having her own yet. Predictability ensues.I read ""Emma"" in early high school as I\'m sure most kids did, and the movie puts a clever spin on the tale. Alicia Silverstone is surprisingly good in her role, perfectly playing a blond bombshell without a brain but a good heart - only Reese Witherspoon has done such a good job recently at portraying the west coast bimbos. (No offense to the west coast bimbos out there.) The movie\'s director, Amy Heckerling, has always been rather reliable on the whole and her direction is solid here - she could have turned ""Clueless"" into a crude, unfunny sex comedy with little wit or brains, but instead she takes a rather dubious idea for a film and transforms it into a well-made, well-acted, funny, inspired, lively, witty satire.Much better than expected.', '""Let\'s set \'Emma\' in a modern high school!""  Does this sound the obvious kind of movie gimmick that everyone uses nowadays?  Perhaps, but it\'s an inspired idea all the same.  Jane Austen\'s characters, and her readers, and the society in which her novels are set, like Jane Austen herself, are HEAVILY conscious of class and social standing.  No atmosphere quite so snobbish exists in the modern world.  EXCEPT, that is, in the corridors and courtyards of the right kind of high school.  And where else in the modern world would you find so many people who seem to spend all their time calling on one another?I was reminded of how well Heckerling moulded ""Emma"" to fit a modern setting when I saw the idiotic 1998 version of ""Great Expectations"", adapted by someone who somehow failed to notice how important all the stuff about class and snobbishness was.  It\'s clear that Heckerling understood her source. She isn\'t afraid to make changes - even radical changes, if the modern setting requires as much - and no character exists MERELY because they have an analogue in Austen\'s novel.  (The most crucial thing is that the Emma-equivalent be sufficiently charming; and so she is.)  The result is a film which is winning and satisfying, whether or not you know anything about the source material.', 'Reading the recent reviews, I can\'t believe dumb kids these days who can\'t appreciate this classic film... clearly, they have no taste in movies, fashion sense, or any sense at all.This is a cult classic. I\'m a guy and I\'m not ashamed to admit I love this movie and one of my favorite movies. Easily one of the best ""teen"" movies ever made.

Barbie/Girl Next DoorThe story is interesting, pacing is great, music is great, cast (with many stars that later ended up being big as well).Yes, the ending is a bit creepy but that fits perfectly that she is clueless. Nevertheless, it\'s a feel good movie.Don\'t forget to check out the music video ""Iggy Azalea feat. Charlie XCX - Fancy"" that pays major homage to this movie; it\'s sooo well done.', ""Considering how long removed I am from both the '90s and high school, there's something entirely relatable about Clueless - and I'm as surprised as anyone. Alicia Silverstone is beyond charming and there's plenty of humor in the supporting cast as well (in particular, the late Brittany Murphy, incandescent in her own right). But the dialogue really put me back in that high school mindset, and I think the movie strikes a nice balance between satire and teen fluff. Like Mean Girls, this is a movie that I've dismissed over the years for being shallow, and for the life of me I can't explain why. This is good stuff.""]"

The South African cast are mainly very good and give good support \x96 the only real flaw was that I wasn't totally convinced that Kumalo's relatives were really his relatives \x96 only Dutton managed to bring out an emotional history and have a sort of bond with Jones, the rest were a little too distant.Overall this is a good version of the book albeit with the focus more on the core narrative than other themes.  The leads are good and it is an involving story.  Not fantastic but a good drama about one man's strength."", 'I could not believe as I read other reviewers of this movie that they thought it ""irrelevant""! The struggle for equality, peace and love is NEVER irrelevant. This was a movie that by any standards is brillant and moving. James Earl Jones does a magnificent job of playing the main character with dignity and restraint. He makes you suffer with him as a result. A drama coach I once had told me, don\'t you cry, let them cry. He does both through his amazing minimalist acting. He doesn\'t waste himself on meaningless gestures & histronics, he lets you see the suffering of his soul. Equally brillant is Richard Harris as the father of the son killed by Jones\' son. These two men are brought together in the worst of circumstances and that is when the true character of the man is revealed. Despite all his racist comments earlier in the movie, he overcomes his own self-hate (translated to Africans) to see the bigger picture that his own son knew all along. Someone once said, you cannot hate anything in someone else, unless it reflects something you hate within yourself. Through the pain & death of his son, he transcends his own sense of self-loathing. He sees with the eyes of love that people are just people, no matter what color their skin is. A movie that communicates that is never irrelevant or unimportant.', 'Emily, a senior, is reading the book as an assignment for her English class. We watched to movie on VHS, as part of her getting extra credit. She hadn\'t finished the book yet, but commented that much of the movie was directly out of the book, so I suspect overall it is faithful to its source.James Earl Jones is Rev Stephen Kumalo, living in the country, and goes to Johannesburg to find his son and a young woman. Much of the first half of the movie can be bordering on boring as the characters are established.Richard Harris is wealthy white James Jarvis, who also lives in the country near Kumalo. They have seen each other, but do not actually know each other. Jarvis also has a son, who is in Johannesburg, and works with the poor, even the poor blacks, in a life that the elder Jarvis doesn\'t quite understand. He still subscribes to the idea that ""they have their place and we have ours"", apartheid.The movie is competently done, with competent acting, but comes across as a simple, no-frills movie. The message is important, but the movie itself is rather bland.SPOILERS. Jarvis\'s son turns up dead, murdered by three black men who are in his home to rob him. The shooter is Kumalo\'s son, who confesses, but says he was scared, didn\'t mean to kill anyone. After a trial the son is found guilty and sentenced to hang. On the day of the hanging, the dad goes up to the mountain to reflect, and Jarvis meets him there. Through this tragedy both men come to appreciate each other, and the need for healing amongst the blacks and whites in S. Africa.', ""I've seen this movie twice and I absolutely love it! I think it's highly underrated with the average of 6.4 from the imdb voters.This is a movie about black and white. A welknown theme in Hollywood, but I've never seen a movie which deals with this subject so excellent as this one.I couldn't help crying at the end. my rate: 10"", 'I read CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY in high school, and was quite impressed by it\'s dignified and somber retelling of the tragedy of modern South Africa under the apartheid system that was in place at the time. Alan Paton had a literary and political career in the Union of South Africa, and was opposed to the system that kept down the native Black Africans while the native white Africans ruled them. His novel was quite shocking in his home country, and led to his being forbidden to be published there. Now he seems remarkably prescient.The novel was made into a film in 1951, which I never saw. But I have finally seen this version today and while it whittles down the plot a bit, it\'s emphasis on the dual tragedy of the Kumalo and Jarvis families actually enhances the effect.James Earl Jones plays Rev. Stephen Kumalo, an honorable man from the countryside who goes to Johannisburg to find his son Absolom. From the start we see contrasts. The beauties and glories of the magnificent veld v. the dirt and grime of the city. The large home of the Jarvis family as opposed to the poor homes of Rev. Kumalo. Rev. Kumalo goes to an address in one of the slums of Johannisburg that the Blacks were forced to live in. He tries to trace his son, with the assistance of a fellow minister, Rev. Msimangu ( Vasi Kunene) and gets less helpful assistance from his brother John Kumalo (Charles S. Dutton). The latter is a local politician, but is soon revealed to be an opportunist and crook. Eventually Rev. Kumalo finds his son has been in trouble with the police, and recently released from a reformatory. This was due to Absolom having a pregnant girlfriend. The Reverend traces his son to the girlfriend, but she has not heard from him for a few days. The next thing that the Reverend hears is that Absolom and two others (including the son of John Kumalo) were involved in a burglary murder that resulted in the death of Ian Jarvis.Tom Jarvis, long used to accept the harsh separation of the races as natural, comes to a stunning discovery - his son\'s posthumous condemnation of the social system of South Africa as one to abhor as it breeds crime and hatred. The discovery of this side to his son leads him to slowly find a bridge uniting him with Rev. Kumalo, as they both find the system destroy their boys.One has to see the film to understand this bridging of the the lives of the fathers (ironically neighbors who rarely knew each other or each other\'s families in the ""normal"" period). One also sees the warning that Paton instilled in his readers: Rev. Msimangu\'s fear that when the White race finally turns to love the Black race will only accept hate.Much is dropped of the four hundred fifty page novel, such as Paton\'s ritualistic use of descriptions again and again (which can\'t be translated to film successfully) or plot threads regarding the final break between the Reverend and his brother John, or the Reverend trying to trace other lost children from the town (one is mentioned briefly). But the somberness of the tragedy of Absolom, who with Ian become joint blood sacrifices to a racist state is total. The performances of Jones and Harris are equally effective. Altogether a first rate film version of the novel.', ""What makes this film so good, is that it deals with the issues of Apartheid in a sensitive, and moving way. There is no overt message of hatred, but shows rather how lives both black and white are affected by division and hatred. The words of Jarvis's dead son are incredibly powerful, significant, even to this day. I grew up in Natal, and lived in Johannesburg, and experienced the evils of Apartheid. Yes, the film is in a way too soft in this regard, but this is not what the film is about. James Earl Jones's depiction of an African Cleric in this time period is amazingly accurate. I had tears in my eyes watching his performance. Harris too shines. This is a movie for today, and is as relevant now, as it was 50 years ago. Must see viewing."", 'It\'s been a long time since I read the Alan Paton book upon which this film is based. Paton was banned in his own country and officially silenced but the book was universally popular throughout the 1960s.James Earl Jones once again renders a bravura performance as the African minister whose son has accidentally killed a white man. One can feel his grief and his burden as he tries to straighten the mess out. His son has confessed but others involved have denied knowledge of the offense.Richard Harris plays an equally difficult role that of Mr Jarvis the white boy\'s father. One feels his grief and pain especially when he finds to his surprise that his son had disowned ""baaskap,"" the over-lordship of the white race, something accepted as a given by most whites without a second thought just as the white housewife perfunctorily dismissed the black cleric in priestly garb as if he were a pesty door to door salesman.Will mercy be extended to the preacher\'s son who accidentally pulled the trigger and cooperated with authorities or will he suffer the ultimate penalty while accomplices go free? Yet for all the misery the movie, surprisingly without excessive preaching, ends on a flicker of hope for the future.', ""Apartheid was a grotesque social experiment aimed at perpetuating the evils of colonialism after the age of empires was past; white liberal Alan Paton one of its most celebrated literary critics. Darrell Roodt's film of perhaps his most famous book, Cry, the Beloved Country', stars Richard Harris and James Earl Jones (better known as the voice of Darth Vader, which leads to some unintentionally comic moments) and is not an awful film; but politically, it misses its targets. Aided by some slushy background music, it invests most of its black characters with a frankly ludicrous level of dignity; while oddly underplaying its depiction of the routine dehumanisation that black people suffered under white rule. In consequence, the film's only real anger appears directed not at the system but at Jones's brother, a nasty and opportunist anti-apartheid campaigner, which was surely not quite the original point. At the end of the film, an impassioned quote from Paton appears on the screen; it's a shame it seems so unconnected with what has preceded it."", 'This is a wonderful movie, based on the famous book.  It features excellent camera work, which took full advantage of the beautiful scenery in the South African countryside.  It also features an exceptional score by John Barry. In addition, the performances were quite good, although I\'ve heard some people say they thought that James Earl Jones made Rev Kumalo too ""soft around the edges"".  In any case, this is a quite good movie.']"
37,41,114279,31174.0,"['This is one of the movies you remember for a long time - and for all the good reasons. Transplanting Shakespeare in a different time and giving his historical plots a modern political sense is not such a new idea. What is really strong and works well here is the perfect fit between the characters as Shakespeare intended them and the background which is so different from the original historical one. Each one of the characters is both shakespearian as intended, a perfect citizen of the fictional time created by the director - a fascist England in the 30s - and more than everything else a human being: sensual, hating and loving as only humans do.\nPerfectly acted, almost flawlessly directed, with very little overweight, this film is a feast for the intelligent spectator, a brutal, well-paced and expressive piece of art - and exactly as Shakespeare would have loved it, a mirror of his time, of our time, and of any time. 9/10 on my personal scale.', ""I'm not always comfortable with Shakespeare in modern dress, nor with Ian McKellen's apparent assumption of the mantle of Olivier and Gielgud. Neither did I think that anything could top the experience of seeing Antony Sher play the role on the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Bosworth.So after all the unfavourable comment, I was shocked to find this version comprehensively squashing all such reservations. It's brilliantly thought out, superbly played and totally gripping from start to finish.The updating to a non-specific inter war period is not just apposite but genuinely illuminating. The games McKellen plays with the changing techniques of warfare in the period, the rise of fascism, realpolitik and the undermining of royalty by the Wallis Simpson affair, push back the boundaries of Shakespeare on film in all directions.For example, at the very moment you're thinking that all this mayhem is a bit much in English period costume, the helmets change, then the uniforms get darker, the red flags appear and Richard's acceptance speech turns into an underground Nuremburg Rally - a stark reminder of just how deeply the country flirted with fascism in the 30s and just how short and steep the descent can be. Stanley's troops, crucially uncommitted, stood off overlooking the real Battle of Bosworth. McKellen's Richard has control of the railway network here, but Wing Commander Stanley denies him the all-important air support in a superb piece of updated analogy. Throughout, modernity is so carefully and relevantly overlaid on the plot structure that it becomes one of the great pleasures and achievements of the piece. Lots of surprises, not the least of which comes as the play's most famous line is perfectly re-engineered and delivered and lots of great players at the top of their form.McKellen, Scott Thomas, Broadbent, Downey Jnr and Annette Bening are all worth the price of admission individually, but there's hardly a flaw in any of the performances.I simply can't see what the detractors are on about at all. Really. An epic piece of work. Easily the best version on film. Easily the most thought provoking Shakespeare on film."", '""Richard III"" may not have the all-encompassing understanding of uman nature seen in ""Hamlet"" or the grace and mastery of ""The Tempest"", but for my money is one of the greatest plays ever written and certainly Shakespeare\'s most entertaining. It may be lacking in character development and psychology, but it more than makes up for that with a brilliant concept: have the villain as main character and make the audience his playful confident. The concept is aided further by eminently quotable lines and one great scene after the other of scheming, fiendishness and confrontations. One of the few pieces of criticism you can successfully throw at Shakespeare is that his central characters are often meek or feeble. Not so here! Tudor propaganda this might have been (it quite grotesquely disregards historical fact in a few places), this is storytelling at its finest.Richard Loncraine\'s 1995 film places the story in a fictitious 30s England reminiscent of early Nazi Germany. The device serves to make the proceedings more accessible (if only marginally since the original language has thankfully been preserved). It also makes for amusing situations (Richard of York telling his monologue while taking a leak in a public restroom - ""my Kingdom for a Horse!"" bellowed from a paralyzed jeep) and serves as further proof of the Bard\'s timelessness.Beyond the structural and technical feats - and they are quite excellent without exception, including Trevor Jones underrated dark jazzy score - lies what should be our main concern: the cast. Sir Ian McKellen as Richard is a Machiavellian wonder, blowing both Lawrence Olivier\'s rendition and McKellen\'s earlier work away. His fiendish creation is a joy to watch and root for, despite the increasing gruesomeness of his crimes. The byzantine plot demands that recognizable faces be cast in supporting roles and the characters are magnificently portrayed by eminent actors giving it their best and succeeding admirably. Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent and Kristin Scott-Thomas are expectedly great, but the truly outstanding supporting performances come as surprises: Annette Benning is all grief and fury, Adrian Dunbar is eerie yet very human as Richard\'s pet killer Tyrell and Nigel Hawthorne is incredibly moving as the meek Clarence. Even Robert Downey Jr. manages to hold his own against this impressive array of actors.All in all if you can appreciate the language (that only gets better with repeated readings/viewings) and have a thirst for fine acting, it would be criminal to ignore this masterpiece.', ""This film sets Shakespeare's Richard III in an alternative to WWII era England, where fascists and royalists maintain their own militias and play power games with kings and thrones. The first scene sets the tone for the entire film. A young officer is settling down to dinner with his dog chewing on a bone nearby. The building begins to shake and a low rumbling is heard. Soon enough, a tank erupts through the fireplace and stormtroopers charge in automatic rifles ablaze. Ian McKellan removes his gas mask and spouts a few lines of Shakespearean dialog.The action and the intrigue never really let up, as the film follows Richard's (McKellan) rise to infamy and power. Neither does the Shakespearean dialog. Somehow the cast manages to make the dialog fit the action and setting effortlessly.Richard III is jarringly strange - perhaps the most innovative of the recent Shakespeare updates - very well acted and directed. Although I recommend the film, I have to warn you - it's not for everyone."", 'From the very first Shakespeare film (a silent version of ""King John,"" of all things), filmmakers have sought to impose their own unique visions on Shakespeare; in the case of ""King John,"" it was fairly simple (a scene of John signing the Magna Carta, which isn\'t in Shakespeare\'s play). Ever since, Shakespeare adaptations have faced the difficulty of remaining true to the greatest writer in the history of the English language while bringing something new to the table; filmed plays, after all, belong on PBS, not in the cinema.Luckily, the minds behind this adaptation of ""Richard III"" is more than up to the challenge. To be fair, putting the movie in an alternate 1930\'s Fascist England doesn\'t serve the sort of lofty purpose that, say, Orson Welles\' 1930s updating of ""Julius Caesar"" (intended to condemn the Fascist governments in Europe at that time) did. What it does do is allow the filmmakers to have a lot of fun. It\'s not necessarily more accessible -- the Byzantine intrigues and occasionally confusing plot can\'t be tempered by simply moving the setting ahead 500 years -- but it\'s definitely more entertaining. There\'s just something inherently amusing about Richard sneaking off for a pee after the ""winter of our discontent"" speech (still rambling on as he, ahem, drains the main), or giving the ""my kingdom for a horse!"" bit while trying to get his Jeep out of the mud.To be sure, the Fascist England shown in the film isn\'t very convicing -- from OUR historical hindsight -- but this isn\'t our world, this is a world fashioned from the imagination that just happens to look like our own, just as Shakespeare\'s were. You can\'t criticize ""King Lear"" for its faux-historical setting any more than you can criticize this film for the same reason.The complaint registered by a previous commentator -- more or less, ""if you\'re going to move Shakespeare to a new period, you need to be true to that period"" -- is utter bollocks, really. After all, it is inherently ""untrue"" to have people running around speaking Elizabethan dialogue in the 1700s, 1800s, 1900s, etc., so if you try to remain ""true,"" you end up stripping away the dialogue -- the very essence of Shakespeare. I agree with the even more controversial Shakesperean theatre director Peter Sellars in that words are not what makes Shakespeare great, but rather his characters and ideas. But Shakespeare communicated those through his words, and if you change them, it\'s not Shakespeare anymore. The same commentator pointed to Branagh\'s more faithful interpretations as a counterweight to this film, yet Branagh\'s ""Hamlet"" is not only set in the 18th century but in a country that looks nothing like 1700s Denmark, even though the characters refer to it as such.The complaints about McKellen\'s ""hamminess"" are equally unfounded. What are they using as their basis of comparision? Olivier? Olivier\'s Richard makes McKellen\'s look positively restrained by comparision. Richard is egotistical, bombastic, and prone to spouting lines like ""thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine."" I have little doubt in my mind that Skakespeare did not intend Richard to be played ""straight"" -- indeed, if Shakespeare had any concept of what we call ""camp,"" he was probably thinking of it when he wrote the play. From this point of view, the ""silly"" little touches like the Al Jolson song at the end and even the newsreel of Richard\'s coronation fit in perfectly.As with most Shakespeare films, the plot has been streamlined -- nearly all of the characters are here, but scenes and speeches have been truncated and removed, but despite what some have said, these aren\'t fatal to the plot or the characters. Richard\'s seduction of Anne does seem to occur to quickly, but it\'s not a completely successful one, seeing how she lapses into drug addiction later in the film. Besides, Richard\'s evil has nothing to do with the fact that his ""inability to experience romantic love."" Richard isn\'t a psychological portrait like Hamlet, he\'s a ruthless bastard, a piece of Tudor propaganda. When people praise ""Richard III"" (the play), it\'s not for its character depth.I notice I\'ve focused more on answering the film\'s detractors instead of dilineating its merits; in a way, I guess this expresses how much I like it. The cinematography, direction, and acting are all top-notch. The sets are perfect, once you realize that this is NOT historical England -- the power plant subbing for the Tower is more imposing than the real thing could ever be, and the factory ruins that serve as Bosworth Field are certainly more interested than a bunch of tanks and Jeeps roaming around the open countryside. Shakespeare purists will, of course, hate it, but then they hate anyone who dares to put anything more than a cosmetic spin on the Bard, be it Welles\' ""Voodoo \'Macbeth\'"" or Brook\'s stage production of ""Titus Andronicus."" For everyone else, read the play, then see the movie -- it\'ll help increase your appreciation of both.', ""Shakespeare's tragedy set in 1940s war-torn England. As someone who loves Shakespeare, I grant a lot of latitude and respect to any person who can get these modern versions produced. The vogue now is to alter the time period, while still holding, generally speaking, to the original plot and language. As usual with the movies, its now done so often that traditional Shakespeare has become a custom more honored in the breach than in the observance. (forgive me!) This is ok, it takes the evil Richard III and plops him into the role of fascist usurper and dictator, during the notorious fascist period of England's history. I know, try and not overthink it. The acting and collection of performers are both first rate, and the film offers interesting moments for both the novice and expert Shakespearean student. There is one thing and it is what prompted me to even write this. If you notice during Richard's ascendance, a formal ball is thrown and a Vera Lynn type woman is shown singing a Glenn Miller type tune. You know you have never heard it, but yet is eerily memorable. I find out years later (today in fact) it is a Christopher Marlowe poem, clevely fitted to a WW2 sounding musical number. Somehow, its just real creepy and its in keeping with the mood of the entire movie. Upsetting and unnerving, with the evil spread just a little too generously over the characters. If you have a big blender, and throw in a copy of 1984, Richard III, and Godfather III, this is what you would end up with."", 'There are two definitive film productions of Richard III: - Sir Laurence Olivier\'s 1955 film version, which he directed and in which he plays the title role, supported by Sir Cedric Hardwicke as King Edward, Sir John Gielgud as Clarence, the delectable Claire Bloom as the Lady Anne and a host of other brilliant performers - and Ian McKellen\'s 1995 version, screenwritten by McKellen and director Richard Loncraine, in which McKellen also plays the title role.While the Olivier version is the definitive classic presentation of the play on film and should serve anyone who wants to see the play as it was intended to be seen (albeit the Colley Cibber adaptation), McKellen\'s adaptation captures the spirit of the play in modern context. The movie opens with the Lancastrians in their war room receiving word of Richard, Earl of Gloucester\'s holding Tewksbury by teletype, then soon their war room is breached by a tank, behind which swarm raiders in gas masks, one of whom slays the Prince of Wales and then the King himself, before removing his gas mask (one of the old goggle-eyed full-face models the Russians still use) to reveal himself Richard, duke of Gloucester.The scene shifts rapidly to a typical 1930s rich people\'s fete, complete with mellow-voiced torch singer and live orchestra, at which Richard III delivers the ""sun of York"" soliloquy as a toast to his father Edward and the assembled party - and then the scene shifts again to Richard completing the soliloquy to the camera, as he does throughout the film. The address to the camera is a little jarring - McKellen\'s smiling, evilly smirking delivery is a little over the top, what you\'d imagine the Blackadder films would have been if they hadn\'t gone for laughs.But Ian McKellen carries the role off very well... his not-quite-sane, quite unbalanced and power-mad schemer Richard III is entirely plausible as a 1930s dictator-king in the central European mold. The uniforms shift from the standard British armed forces\' khakis to the blacks and greys of Hitler and Mussolini as Britain slides into fascism under her scheming ""Lord Protector.""The screen action is taut, visually compelling - even when McKellen bellows ""A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!"" from a World War II Dodge weapons carrier/""command car,"" the scene doesn\'t degenerate into incongruous, unintentional comedy, because by then the viewer is caught up in the tale of this wild-eyed sociopath who has just about run out of rope - and since the truck is axle-deep in sand, stuck, a horse is just what Richard could have used around then.There\'s just enough realism in the 1930\'s props to help with willing suspension of disbelief - no more. Military history buffs will not be happy. No matter. What is communicated very well is the senseless welter of fully-joined battle, fiery slaughter and Richard III\'s lashing out in senseless rage, eventually as much against his own men as the enemy.The Duke of Stanley\'s last-minute defection against Richard\'s forces in the final battle is all the sharper for Stanley being the commander of the air force (his loyalty to Richard III in the coming battle with Henry, Earl of Richmond seemingly assured by his young son\'s being held hostage in Richard III\'s war train) - so that the viewer no sooner hears the news of the defection in the play\'s dialogue than Richard\'s forces are strafed and bombed by Stanley\'s war planes as Richmond\'s forces swarm into Richard\'s assembly area, cutting the Ricardian army to pieces.Lots of interesting touches in the screenplay, such as Queen Elizabeth and her brother Earl Rivers (played ably by Annette Bening and rather indifferently by Robert Downey, Jr - who only manages to convince in the scene when he is assassinated in bed while submitting to the erotic ministrations of a Pan Am stewardess) playing their roles as Americans - using the homage to Wallis Simpson and her husband the Duke of Windsor (who abdicated his kingdom to marry Simpson because she wasn\'t only a commoner but a divorced American) to bring needed tension among the royals to the play. In case the viewer\'s a little too thick to realize that Downey\'s character is an American, not only does he lay the flat, nasal accent on thicker than Hell, but on landing in England, he steps out of an airliner painted in bright Pan-American Airlines livery, where he is met by his royal sister Elizabeth and her children. Bening\'s performance is more nuanced and sympathetic than Downey\'s - the conundrum of Elizabeth\'s brother being a Peer and obviously an American at the same time is just left out there. But before long, we\'re McKellen\'s willing co-conspirators and agree to forget this lapse.Maggie Smith as Richard\'s mother Queen Margaret is stellar in her portrayal of a mother torn between the remnants of love for her twisted, lethal offspring and mourning the rest of her family dead because they stood in Richard\'s way to the throne. Her delivery of Margaret\'s of the advice Elizabeth asks for on how to curse Richard (Act 4, Scene 4):""QUEEN ELIZABETH O thou well skill\'d in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies! QUEEN MARGARET Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; Compare dead happiness with living woe; Think that thy babes were fairer than they were, And he that slew them fouler than he is!""is one of the best-delivered lines in Shakespeare on film I have seen.In closing one compares McKellen\'s Richard III to Anthony Hopkins\' Hitler in ""The Bunker"" - an eerie channeling of one of history\'s foulest personalities, so that one feels one\'s self in his foul presence watching the show. Masterful work.', 'I think updating Shakespeare\'s plays to more modern eras can be a good idea, but attempts quite often fail due to ""modernizing"" of the original text into the current vernacular, adding modern slang terms and modern pop-political slants and such things. Happily, Richard Loncraine\'s version of \'Richard III\' works very well, being set in a surreal WW2 era setting, more reminiscent of Terry Gilliam\'s \'Brazil\' than London as it actually was at that time; an alternative world is suggested which adds a touch of nightmare-fantasy to the film.I think this sort of intelligent interpretation of the text, placed into the mouths of people we can relate to more readily than we do to Elizabethan personages, is valuable and helps people otherwise unfamiliar with, or daunted by, Shakespeare\'s strange language is a good thing. All of life is covered in Shakespeare\'s plays, and after reading them it becomes apparent that nothing new has appeared in the world since, as far as fundamental life issues are concerned, making them invaluable tools in the history of literature as lynch-pins for people trying to navigate the shoals of human quirkiness without succumbing to depression and despair at the human condition. For instance, when O.J. Simpson\'s trial was going on I kept thinking of Othello and Desdemona, a tragedy of passion and murder being re-enacted for millions on the television.Richard III is all about power and how it corrupts. Richard is presented as a Hitler-like character. It\'s an ugly story, yet the light of goodness shines through in the roles of the Duchess of York, Maggie Smith, and Queen Elizabeth, Annette Beining.The cast is superb. I was put-off at first by Robert Downey Jr\'s Anthony, Earl of Rivers, because of his very-American accent. But Rivers has just returned from overseas, and given the setting, he could very well have returned from a long stint in New York. Once used to this he settled in nicely with the balance of the cast. Beining\'s accent is less noticeable. She is a fine, well-trained classical actress and knows what Shakespeare is all about. In the end she is a powerful foil to Ian McKellan\'s riveting Richard III.The use of \'40s swing tunes works wonderfully, I especially enjoyed the tune that accompanies Richard to his death, it\'s very funny, and horrifying all at once.Even if you don\'t like Shakespeare I recommend this film. It\'s a great story and the technical aspects of it are top-drawer.', 'When I see how wonderful this Richard III is, it immediately makes me question what in the world has Kenneth Branagh been doing all these years? Certainly nothing as imaginative, as provocative as this.Deprived of Shakespeare as a child, I have been forced to catch up piece meal through film. Al Pacino\'s ""Looking for Richard"" gives attention to Richard III, from a far different perspective, but both that film and this agree that it has all the key elements of great drama: evil ambition, betrayal, rivalry.The casting is tremendous with Ian McKellen (from his own stage play) and Kristen Scott-Thomas in the leads-thankfully there is no Kenneth Branagh to be found. And is this guy Jim Broadbent any good, or what? For my money he steals every scene he plays in ""Little Voice"", he\'s subtly brilliant here in a lesser role. Only Annette Benning seems a little overmatched in her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth, but that\'s hardly surprising.The accessibility of the current version, the setting in 1930\'s Fascist Europe, gives the story a vibrancy that is present from the first frame to the last.Challenging, fun, and educative-far more than most films deliver. I highly recommend.']"

It was a well acted and well directed drama that seemed to be funny when it needed to be (thank you Chris Tucker), dramatic when it needed to be, and even violent when it needed to be. Some of, if not most of the violence was pretty graphic--that can be taken as a positive or negative. I\'m not perturbed by it, but I can see how some are.I loved the story. It was simple yet complex. It was really about five years in the life of a young Black man from New York spanning from 1968 to 1973.

I think ""Dead Presidents"" was an excellent production that didn\'t short change us at all in any aspect.', ""I really enjoyed this movie. Everyone in it did an excellent job and it was very gripping. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Larenz Tate, in his best role ever, plays Anthony Curtis, a young black man from late 1960's The Bronx, who is just a regular guy who hangs out with his friends played by Chris Tucker also in his best role ever as Skip, and Freddy Rodriguez as Jose. Shortly after graduation from high school, Anthony decides he doesn't want to follow his big brother's path of going to college but instead, joining the Marine Corps and fight for his country. Shortly thereafter, we are taken to Vietnam with the boys and we meet some other interesting characters, one of them a psychotic preacher, Cleon, played by Bokeem Woodbine,and the Vietnam sequences are executed very realistically and are very bloody. After a while, we are taken back to the boogie down Bronx, where Anthony upon returning to the old neighborhood after four years,realizes that things are even worse than before, and everyone, including his pre-Vietnam girlfriend, Juanita, all have taken their lives in a different direction. Anthony is now a father, and cannot find a job anywhere and realizes that his own country has turned his back on him and many young black veterans from 'Nam, including his old boys Skip and Jose. We also meet Kirby, played by Keith David, a once cold and ruthless hustler, who has now left the life because the corruption of the city has forced him to quit his old habits, and Juanita's sister Delilah, played by N'Bushe Wright, who is an activist with the Black Panthers. Pretty soon all of these characters, save Juanita, fed up with their lives and their situation, get together to plan a stickup on an armored truck that is making a pickup of old dollar bills and is taking them to a location in Washington to burn them. The stickup sequence is very well made, but of course, bloody. This movie is filled with great performances, the best coming from Larenz Tate, Bokeem Woodbine and Keith David, heart-pounding action and good dialogue. A Hughes Brothers' classic. 9.5 out of 10."", ""This was a great movie, and I think it was overlooked. It is one my favorites due to the unique storytelling and action. This movie is way better than 90% of the crap that comes out today. The acting is also superb, and I think it Chris Tucker's greatest performance. Even though the story has a lot of action, it's very believable, which is hard to do in Hollywood. For those who haven't seen this movie I suggest you go and rent it now, it's a modern day classic. Sit back and be prepared to watch a great moment in filmaking. It's definitely underrated. I think if it was promoted better it might have done better, especially since most war movies do well."", '""Dead Presidents,"" the Hughes Brothers\' ambitious 1995 follow-up to their equally ambitious debut, the gritty and ultraviolent 1993 drama ""Menace II Society,"" is about as ambitious as most films can get, and in some ways it\'s better than their previous film, and in some ways it\'s not.Many have taken note of co-directing team Allen and Albert Hughes\' referencing to their cinema heroes like Martin Scorsese and the bloody gangster classic ""Scarface."" Indeed, observant viewers will note the explicit bloodshed that\'s prevalent in ""Dead Presidents"" as being homage to the graphic gangster pictures of yesteryear, and that doesn\'t make it bad.""Presidents"" takes a look at the role that the color green played in the lives young black men before and after Vietnam. In fact, on the killing fields of good old \'Nam, mankind is seen at its absolute lowest, where soldiers on both sides of the conflict commit horrific atrocities, including a scene where a black soldier decapitates a (dead) Viet Cong and keeps the head for good luck, or when an American soldier is gutted and castrated.Obviously, the Hughes Brothers have some real big qualms about black mens\' involvement in that conflict, and the film\'s central character, Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate), finds little prospects awaiting him in the Bronx after doing two tours in Vietnam.Before he left, however, he\'d impregnated his girlfriend Juanita (Rose Jackson) and while in country, he doesn\'t permit himself to think of what he\'s left behind in America. So when Anthony\'s forced to leave his low-paying job as a meat cutter, it\'s not a surprise that he\'s already begun plans to knock off an armored truck to get some ""dead presidents,"" which is street slang for dollar bills.So, together with his two involuntarily enlisted Vietnam buddies Skip (Chris Tucker) and Jose (Freddy Rodriguez), Anthony\'s Uncle Kirby (Keith David), Juanita\'s radicalized sister Delilah (N\'Bushe Wright) and Cleon (Bokeem Woodbine), they proceed to knock over the truck and make way with its valuable assets.The film is most definitely a gritty look at the ""black experience"" during the Civil Rights era and the Hughes Brothers certainly pay a lot more attention to the details of the picture. It\'s not better than ""Menace,"" but is certainly better-made, now that they have been given a more reasonable budget.10/10', 'For all those who liked the movie ""Menace 2 Society"",you are going to love this one. This movie features the star from Menace to Society ""Larenz Tate"" and the well known ""Chris Tucker"". This is a very violent movie and have a few very gory scenes of the Vietnam war,but that is okay because this movie really shows how difficult it must have been for a black man growing up in the Bronx in the 60\'s.And it shows how life is for him and his friends after coming home from the Vietnam war. The language in this movie is of course very tough and rough and I could actually count the f-word 247 times in this movie and that speaks for it\'s self.This is an extremely well made movie that really shows the reality of how hard the world can be for some people.I advice everybody to go out and pick up this movie, because it is a story that you got to hear.', 'Chris Tucker is hilarious in this movie, he has great on screen charisma, and he speaks his lines very fluidly, as if he was improvising. Larenz Tate is great as well, being able to pull off the young version of his character, since he has a boyish face.  And Bokeem Woodbine reminds me of Samuel L. Jackson in this movie.  The cinematography is also great and so is the acting overall.  Like everyone says, its not so much as a heist movie, but a reflection on the hardships of the black individual, such as finding work and drug abuse; after fighting a war that wasnt really meant for them or their country.', 'The Hughes Brothers tried to play up the same angle with ""Dead Presidents"" as Micheal Cimino and Louis Garfinkle did with ""The Deer Hunter"" by portraying the social effects that the Vietnam war had on its young veterans.  And for a while, it seemed as though they were quite successful. But in the end, it became apparent why ""The Dead Presidents"" fell short of the Academy recognition that ""The Deer Hunter"" won.Set in the late 60s and early 70s, the plotline of ""Dead Presidents"" follows a promising and popular inner-city high school graduate, Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate), who decides to forego college and enter the Vietnam War as a member of the Marine Corps.  Anthony survives a graphic and arduous three-plus-year stint in the jungle, but upon his homecoming, he realizes that the ""real world"" can be just as trying as war.  His low-paying job provides little support for his new family and he becomes desperate to make ends meet.  He enlists the help of some old friends and plans a daring armored car heist which, if successful, could serve to amend his past and brighten his future...The first seventy-five minutes of this movie were really well done. Character traits and relationships were well-established and the mood was properly set as suspense built for the anticipated war scenes--a perfect ""epic-caliber"" introduction.But instead of continuing with a detailed flow, the directing crew tried to cram about ninety minutes worth of material into the final forty-five minutes, and consequently did not leave themselves enough time to totally develop any strong climactic progression or aptly characterize any of the cast members into their sudden postwar ""criminal complex.""  Thus, the ""heist scene,"" which based on advertising was probably supposed to be one of the more memorable and authoritative parts of the film, seemed to be almost too ""spur-of-the-moment"" and lacked motivation and definition.\nAll in all, the film\'s running time, which was approximately 119 minutes, was simply far too short for the storyline.  The postwar segment of the film (the last forty-five minutes) was indeed key in separating a decent movie like ""Dead Presidents"" from a epic masterpiece like ""The Deer Hunter.""\nBesides the first seventy-five minutes, a couple of notably good performances given by Chris Tucker as Skip (Anthony\'s best friend) and Rose Jackson as Juanita (Anthony\'s girlfriend) do make ""Dead Presidents"" a movie worth seeing at least once.  That said, I would warn not to create a preconception based on the title, tagline or any publicity images that you might have seen, because they apply only to a small portion of the action.']"
39,43,114272,35196.0,"[""The set design and art direction on this movie was entirely mesmerizing! I will never forget the scene in which Dr Merivile returns to court (after The Plague has ravished London) in which this huge heavy swishing pendulum like incense burner, apparently to help ward off sickness... makes such a haunting and ominous sound as it waves smoke across the vast room...you can almost smell it! This movie is robustly lush and unnervingly eerie. As has been mentioned by a few others on the database...it's full of contrast on all levels. Personally, I was gladly surprised at how inventive Robert Downey Jr was with the role of Robert Merivel. He began with a laughing stupidity which grew to eventual compassion and downright intellect by the end of his story. Sam Neil is always all around proficient at what ever he takes on, his portrayal here is no exception, although I think he granted Charles II a lot of likableness and charm that was surely improbable in reality. Got to love the fifty or so Spaniels meandering with him down the plush hallways of the nobility through out the kingdom. And the scenes with intricate scientific inventions and mechanisms of the era were sheer beauty to behold.  At the same time there was such desperation and bleak contrast when dealing with the devastation and hopelessness of The Plague...only to be followed by the horrific Fire Of London. It's a wonder civilization survived at all in England at the time. The movie's art direction was of such a brilliant intensity. Parts of the script were a bit slow but the visuals tended to make up for it. The only truly unfortunate aspect of the film was the casting of Meg Ryan...just Plumb Awful(as they say)in the role of Dr Merivil's asylum inmate lover....who was by the way, miraculously cured of her insanity by his physical attentions. Whoever twisted Hollywood arms to get her on this project should be quartered and drawn.\nConsidering all, this movie made me curious enough to download a copy of Samuel Pepys Diary 1665 to read more about the history of the Restoration. Isn't that what a good historical adaptation should do?"", 'Europe of the 1600\'s has often been an overlooked era, sandwiched between the idealism and art of the Elizabethan/Shakespearean Age (late 1500s) and the Enlightenment of the 1700\'s. In many ways, 1600s England was a transitional time reflecting the growth of England toward a modern sensibility while still being hindered by the traditions and outlooks of the past, primarily the hold of Medieval thought which held to a strict hierarchical strata while discouraging and even destroying the pursuit of knowledge and truth.Robert Downey Jr. does a tremendous job as a character that appears to be a fore-runner of the coming Enlightenment. He is a physician on the verge of ground-breaking new scientific discoveries in the area of medicine. However, through a serendipitous and at first fortuitous run-in with King Charles II, the Restoration monarch (played brilliantly by Sam Neill), Downey loses his way and becomes a willing pawn in the king\'s sexual chess games. He even forsakes his precious medical texts to a colleague. In return, Downey gains a royal title, a royal tract of land, servants, and a wife. The only stipulation that is placed upon him: He cannot touch his own wife--she ultimately belongs to the King as one of his many mistresses.In this way, Charles II is still a monarch enacting a role that was first prescribed in the Middle Ages: that of the absolute ruler with absolute authority that can use his subjects for his own whims, and he can also discard those that are no longer useful. Simultaneously, there is another side to Charles II. Although he is the son of his late father Charles I, Charles II is the heir to Cromwell who devoted time and money to philanthropic projects, such as the study of science and medicine, the improvement of architecture, and the creation of schools. Charles II continues the enterprises begun by Cromwell and becomes a transitional monarch who has aspects that reflect both the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment.In many ways, Restoration is about these two worlds, and how Downey lives in both of them, from the luxurious life of a nobleman to the humble physician working with Quakers in an insane asylum. The king is also a person caught in both worlds. At first he appears the selfish ruler using his subjects as chess pieces in a large game in which he is always the bona fide winner. But then in another scene, we see him as a kind of philanthropic monarch financing and encouraging scientific and liberal research and discourse. In an interesting scene, Downey enters a kind of laboratory in which knowledge, research, and discovery are are being supported by the king who presides over the work of many scholars. Behind him is a strange swirling circus-like representation of the cosmos. We can\'t quite tell if the representation depicts the earth as the center of the Universe or the Sun, as if this notion is still being debated. But to his credit, the king is allowing for debate--something a Medieval king under a Medieval Church would have never allowed. Later, we learn that Downey is also an amateur astronomer, gazing at the stars in the heavens with a telescope.Through his adventures in and out of these worlds, Downey sees the light and dark of both and becomes something greater than he had before, particularly through an episode in which he falls in love with one of the patients (Meg Ryan) at the insane asylum. One aspect of the film that is quite revealing is the shades of color used to represent the different ""worlds"". The world of the king is bright and colorful. The world of the Quakers is far more gray, but toward the end of the movie, the world of the king becomes darker hued.In the end, even the King seems to understand the importance of scientific discourse and research--that these ideas could ultimately help not only his people but himself. Medieval monarchs played games with people\'s lives for their own selfish ends, and sometimes stifled those who could make positive contributions to their societies and even humanity at large. Restoration is about the transition from the Medieval model to a new societal design in which personal gain becomes an outcome of talent and contribution and not monarchical whim. Today, we are still challenged by the notion of privilege over substance. People in power still often give major opportunities to those they favor over those that could make important contributions who are less adept at playing the political game.', 'After watching this film, I felt my faith in humanity had been (somewhat) restored, and not for the squishy, feel-good reasons either.  Instead, I felt that filmmakers can often demonstrate truly wondrous, creative talents; Try not to think of all those sumptuous 18th Century European paintings that feature either the rich or the starving, while taking in the cinematic beauty of Hoffman\'s \'Restoration.\'So what if Meg Ryan has a role in this one, I still enjoyed it.  This film is not about her anyway (the film is told from an exclusively patriarchal viewpoint, and doesn\'t sink into syrupy romance... at least not the way I saw it).Eugenio Zannetti (I\'m not entirely sure about the spelling, but he is a production designer of infinite wisdom and talent) created endless aristocratic hallways, gorgeous rooms, and locations of richness and pestilence that exist side-by-side.  Zannetti went on to \'architecturally\' design the central, Rococo menace in ""The Haunting"" (1999).Downey Jr\'s performance (as a doctor) is Raphaelesque, a walking representation of the period in which this story takes place (the anguish and hope he must undergo and have is thespian splendor).  Ian McKellan also appears (need I say more) here as a disheveled, yet benevolent supporting hero.I strongly recommend you experience this \'restorative\' piece of cinematic art.', 'Fortunately, I do not judge a film merely by its technical excellence. Other reviews seemed to overemphasize the limited script, miscasting, lack of focus, etc, that this movie supposedly represents. All of it may be true, and certainly if the movie did not reach me, I too, would come up with a barrelful of sophisticated reasons why it didn\'t work.The problem is, it moved me. It touched my heart in just the right way, and left me once again, with a longing have known everyone who ever lived, suffered and died.Ah, the human condition!The first half of the film was slow, and seemed to be searching for itself. But from the time Robert entered into the home for the insane, it became engrossing. I thought the story of the ""Lost Valley"" was poignant and worth the whole movie. All that came before was necessary background for all that came after.So...not extraordinary, not outstanding, but quietly satisfying and definitely memorable. A little gem -selected with care- to share with those you love.', ""When this movie came out, the movie critics all jumped on and called it a failure. They said it was a hugely disappointing role for Robert Downey, Jr. Although, this movie was not superb, it was at least decent. That's why I never listen to critics. Downey plays an idealistic young surgeon with great promise. Chance has it that King Charles The Second discovers the young surgeon. If he promises not to sleep with the king's mistress, he will marry her and maintain an estate. Downey's Sir Robert is, of course, a man who chases after women, and when he falls in love with her, a spy (played by Hugh Grant) discovers it, reports it to the king, and Sir Robert is banished. Sir Robert finds favor again by devoting himself to treating the victims of the plague of 1660. What I liked about the movie, is that it showed that 1660 was the beginning of the transition to the modern World. Superstitions were falling, and surgeons like Sir Robert were starting to be seen as an asset. The King was even getting into science and medicine. Robert Downey, Jr. also does an excellent job. So, why all the bad reviews?"", ""Restoration is one of the great overlooked gems of the 1990's. This movie is beautifully shot and competently directed. It is based closely on the original novel, and also reminds me of some of the more juicy excerpts from Samuel Pepys Diary. The use of real historical locations in Britain is inspired, for instance, the Fire of London and Cheapside market scenes were shot at Caerphilly Castle, the 13th-century moat doubling for the 17th-century Thames! Robert Downey gives a highly respectable performance as Merivel (and has an excellent British accent), but Meg Ryan is totally mis-cast, seeming very lost in some scenes. Sam Niell, I think, is probably the best casting for a British Monarch since Alec Guiness as Charles the First in Cromwell, and Dudley Sutton as James the First in Orlando. One of the best performances, however, comes from David Thewlis in support. His moving scenes with Downey at Tretower Court steal the movie. I worked as an extra on the movie, and some scenes for Pierce Brosnan's 'Crusoe' were shot back to back on the Cheapside market set. That movie has still to be released. 'Restoration' was filmed during 1994, and was delayed for release amid rumours of re-shooting scenes with Meg Ryan, and probable cold feet after the box-office difficulties with 'The Red Letter'.This movie has not been given the credits it truly deserves, and is an excellent illustration of Court life and marriage politics during the reign of Britain's sexiest Monarch!"", '""Restoration"" is an overlooked jewel of a movie, a fascinating and atmospheric journey to another time and place. Robert Downey, Jr. is outstanding as a young physician who develops depth and compassion. The music, costumes and settings are full of rich detail. While Meg Ryan\'s character as an insane Irish girl was perhaps a bit overwrought, I found little to fault in the movie. I have seen it three times and enjoy it thoroughly each time. I\'m sorry I missed it on the big screen. Interesting scenes portraying 17th century medical practice, the plague, the Great Fire of London. Not for the squeamish, but not overly violent either.', 'Good Lord! a historical epic without a spectacular set piece till the fire of London. There was not a minute of this film I did not enjoy! Those who need chariot races to feel historically present need to know we can\'t all hang out with Cleopatra or Rhett. These people, in this film, came across as real through the ages! After seeing this delight,I mourn for Downey\'s career. Rent, NO! Buy this movie and step back into time for two hours. As historical drama, this is surpassed only by "" A LION IN WINTER"" and ""LAWRENCE OF ARABIA"". Mel Gibson should see this film before he messes with historical characters again. Please, you critics watch this with your heart; not your eye for spectacle \'NUFF SAID!', 'A beautiful & thoughtful movie about chance and caprice in human lives,and about how love and folly shape us. A unity of word, appearance, and action distill the reign of Charles II into the soul of a doctor who lives through a ""new age"" of human flowering. A movie aspiring to and attaining the qualities of a literary novel, powerfully combining the naturalistic and the symbolic, and equal to best adaptations of Jane Austen. Restoration will be certain disappointment for movie-goers who expect explosions instead of drama and grunts.']"

Then, that understanding should dissolve as the world shifts.Who will be the first to make a real game film? Who will try?', ""Following up the spectacular disaster of competing fighting game turned movie, Mortal Kombat succeeded where Street Fighter failed.  Not a fantastic movie nor one that goes in my top ten, but Mortal Kombat (without a doubt) is one of the better game-based-films.MK wisely avoids inventing plot in unwelcomed places and sticks to the game as frequently as it can get away with.  Actually the biggest contradiction that comes to mind is Scorpion and Sub-zero on the same team.  Die hard fans will call the screenwriter on this, the rest of us won't care.All the mistakes Street Fighter made, MK avoided.  Instead of colorful campy cameo-fest, Mortal Kombat comes across as a dark tale about a handful of martial artists shot with an exaggerated epic style with humorous undertones to provide comic relief every now and again.  Then again, it is ironic that Street Fighter would feel cartoony and Mortal Kombat more concrete when looking at the style of the games (drawn sprites versus live actors).  MK is a little silly when reproducing game effects and trademark moves, though now more and more films are moving in that direction (Matrix, anyone?)\nThe movie's premise is the first Mortal Kombat arcade game featuring a few plot hints (journey to Outworld) and a few characters from Mortal Kombat 2 (Kitana, Jax, a youthful Shang Tsung.)Christopher Lambert and Cary-Hiroyuki Takawa make the most memorable impact as Thunder God Rayden and Shape-shifting Sorcerer Shang Tsung.  Both ham up their performances just enough to remind us that we're watching a live-action video game, but they don't go overboard into Street Fighter's territory.  The rest of the cast plays their part straight forward and makes their characters believable.It's a quick and slick film, gets to the action and gets over with before you can ask too many questions.  It's a pretty decent martial arts film, and an outstanding \x91video game' film.  And in 1995, it was the best game-inspired film you could find.  Today it's still in the top five."", ""Based on a popular game of the same title, Mortal Combat was the manufacturer's attempt cash in on the popularity of its game(s).The movie is a good mixture of martial arts, fantasy, and sci-fi. It scores pretty high when viewed as any one of films from these genres - if you use the metric of old school kung-fu, and sci-fi flicks. For instance if I think of this as an extension of Shaw Brothers kung-fu movies from the '70s, it makes lot of sense, and if you look at it from perspective of an old school sci-fi like the Dune, it also makes sense. But if you use the metric of newer sci-fi, and action flicks, this lacks imagination, and is visually antiquated. My point is that this movie is just another extension of what's been done up to that point and added nothing new. Maybe that was the point - not to take too much risk and focus on cashable elements. So it's an okay film, and nothing new, and that's how it stands out today when you watch it. There wasn't anything eye opening about this movie, and none of the characters had endearing characteristics to them. Acting was wooden and below par, but that might have been due to the screen play, but maybe they should have brought in at least one or two A list actors to give life to the whole story. The movie was bit morbid and it was due to lack of acting talent in this movie. So in the end, the company who made it accomplished what it started out to do, and made money, but movie isn't anything of a serious caliber in any area of its production."", ""Terrible CGI. Awful Acting. Clichéd plot. Predictable storyline. Cardboard characters. Disgustingly bad dialogue. Doesn't do 2-player video game justice.

They didn't have the resources to pull off the amount of CGI things they attempted successfully.It is very campy and cheesy.As it has a PG-13 rating, there is nowhere near as much violence as the games contain."", '""The essence of Mortal Kombat is not about death ... but life.""\nMortal Kombat is filled to the brim with bad acting, terrible dialogue, and horrendous CGi.But outside of that, what we have here is a film that cares for its source material and is not afraid of showing it. Whether it be Scorpions fire-spitting skull head, or Johnny Cage doing his splits nut-punch, it shows the creator knew and cared about Mortal Kombats origins and ridiculousness.It doesn\'t shy away from having a lot of fights too. Although not as bloody and gruesome as you\'d expect, they still feel impactful enough to get the point across.Mortal Kombat pleasantly surprised me with how it stayed with its source material unlike most video game film adaptations. It had a pretty decent story and lots of good fights, but it does suffer from some poor acting and dialogue along with some of the worst CGi i\'ve seen. The Goro animatronic was impressive though!EDIT: Reptile is my all time favorite Mortal Kombat character so seeing his HORRENDOUS appearance kind of upset me. But then thankfully redeemed it in the end.', 'A number of martial artists converge in China, from which they\'re taken to a seeming alternate dimension to fight in a tournament that\'s only held ""once each generation"". This time, however, the stakes are even higher, as the outcome of the tournament will determine the fate of the Earth.Believe it or not, this is the first time I\'ve seen this film, and I\'ve not yet had experience with any of the games, the other films, the animated series, the lunchboxes, or anything else related to the Mortal Kombat universe. After watching the first film, however, I definitely will seek out some of the other material, as I enjoyed the film quite a bit--it earns an 8 out of 10 from me. At this point, however, I can\'t compare it to any other instantiations of Mortal Kombat.The film is basically a combination of a classic Hong Kong-styled martial arts actioner and a fantasy that leans slightly to the horror side of that genre. To the film\'s benefit, it\'s also not something that either director Paul W.S. Anderson or writer Kevin Droney take too seriously--the film is ultimately an adaptation of a popular video game, after all. There is a tongue-in-cheek, slightly campy sense of humor and playful cheesiness throughout the film, the humor being primarily fueled from two characters, Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert). True, Lambert has a kind of almost smarmy campiness to anything he says or does, in any film, but for me, that\'s part of his attractiveness--it\'s a large part of what sold me on the Highlander films.The fantasy aspect was something I didn\'t expect before watching the film. It was a very pleasant surprise. Being a huge horror fan, I was especially taken with the set design. The fantasy characters, such as Goro, and the fantasy traits of other characters, were well done and even subtle at times.As for the fights, which are the propelling force behind the film, they\'re pleasantly varied and well choreographed, although having just watched Master of the Flying Guillotine (1975) again recently, I was slightly disappointed that the fights weren\'t more brutal and gory (and in fact, this is one of the areas where I subtracted a point). But they almost make up for the lack of violence but their imaginativeness, especially the fights with Sub-Zero and The Scorpion. That cleverness was required over brawn in most instances was also a nice touch.Overall, this is a great film that any fans of martial arts or fantasy films should enjoy.']"
